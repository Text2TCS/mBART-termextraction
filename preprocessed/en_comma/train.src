Corruption?
Not in our company…    Preventing corruption in corporate life    Preface    Conscious of its central position within the European Union, Belgium has, for many years, taken a firm line against corruption in national and international transactions.
For this purpose, a major reform was carried out at the end of the 1990s.
This affected aspects of both the criminal liability of legal persons and the implications in fiscal and criminal law.
Since then, action against corruption has been a priority of the Belgian government in its National Security Plan 2008-2011.
Corruption occurs in various forms and attracts severe penalties.
By means of this brochure, Belgium wants to raise the awareness of companies engaged in the international markets for goods and services about the consequences of corruption.
Responsible management requires a clear definition of what is acceptable or unacceptable.
Belgium hopes that this brochure will raise the awareness of commercial players and warn them of the risks associated with their business contacts.
What is corruption?
Corruption is a manifestation of criminality.
It can be very damaging to companies and to society.
It leads to distortion of competition, frightens off investors and jeopardizes the further development of sound companies.
Corruption is morally reprehensible and undermines trust in society and in democracy.
The business community sees it as the main obstacle to investment in certain countries.
In the longer term, corruption adds to costs, both to the community and for companies.
Often it is accompanied by a deterioration of quality and safety.
For a natural or a legal person, corruption means the soliciting, acceptance or receipt of any form of advantage, in an official context, to gain acceptance for a given practice or behaviour.
It is also the offering or granting of such advantage to induce a person to accept such behaviour.
The law applies to Belgian individuals and companies active both in Belgium and abroad.
Belgium also makes no distinction between national, international and foreign office-holders.
It makes no difference whether the bribery takes place directly or through intermediaries; nor whether the advantage is intended for oneself or for a third party.
It is also irrelevant whether it happens in the public or the private sector.
Both the person offering such advantages and the recipient can be convicted of corruption.
Therefore Belgian law covers both private and public bribery and both active and passive bribery.
In other words, corruption may occur at various levels and in various forms.
All these forms of corruption are criminal offences in Belgium.
In fact an incidental condition applies to private corruption: it must have taken place without prior knowledge and without the authorisation of, depending on the case, the board of directors or the general assembly, the principal or the employer.
The Belgian Criminal Code contains two chapters of importance in combating corruption.
They are Criminal Code Articles 246 ff., which concern public bribery, and 504bis and ter on private bribery.
Penalties range from six months to three years imprisonment.
If there are aggravating circumstances, the custodial sentence may be up to 10 years.
Fines imposed may amount to up to 100 000 euros.
Criminal proceedings not only attract negative publicity.
A legal person may also be struck off the list of contractors eligible for government contracts.
In Belgium, anyway, companies are debarred from awards of public contracts if they have been convicted of criminal conspiracy, bribery, fraud, money laundering or any other misdemeanour which, by nature, represents a violation of professional ethics.
Other actions are also punishable.
Thus Article 314 of the Criminal Code punishes restriction of the freedom of bidding or of registration for transfers of ownership, usufruct or leasing of movable or immovable property of a company, of a supply etc.
with 15 days to six months imprisonment and a fine of 100 to 3000 euros.
The tax legislation also specifies that each count of corruption, liable to prosecution under the Criminal Code, both for a natural and for a legal person, cannot be deducted from the basis of tax assessment.
Ex officio, a separate amount of 309 % of the value of the count of corruption is levied on the corporate taxpayer.
Plus the statutory 'additional tenths'.
The fine can either be imposed cumulatively with the penalty of imprisonment, or separately.

Plus statutory 'additional tenths'.

What can companies do?
Corruption is one of the main barriers to companies operating on foreign markets.
Depending on the sector and the country, there is a chance of coming into contact with corrupt behaviour sooner or later.
It is therefore as well to be properly prepared for it.
This brochure offers a number of tips on how to avoid and counter corrupt practices.
Codes of conduct forbid corruption, irrespective of its intended purpose.
Therefore the scope of this prohibition is wider than winning or keeping a market.
It applies not only to commission payments to officials, but also to failure to mention such payments in subcontracts, consultancy agreements, contracts of 'technical assistance' abroad, etc.
Payments to local agents must be limited to settlement for lawfully provided services.
The auditing of corporate financial statements must avoid non-transparent or off-books accounting.
Compliance with the rules on funding of political parties is required, and companies' managerial or controlling organs must be informed of accounting irregularities detected.
The main measures constituting good management can be set forth in codes of conduct.
Nevertheless, the best signal to a company's staff is the example set by its managers.
Besides, sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between corruption and normal business contacts.
Grey areas do exist, in which special attention must be paid to resolving awkward situations.
Trading with Saddam Hussein's Iraq was highly profitable, but could also have serious consequences, both for the company's reputation and in criminal law.
Moreover, commission had to be paid to Iraqi officials and their intermediaries.
Belgium punishes the bribing of both foreign officials and people acting for a Belgian government department.
The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) carries out assessments to ensure that national governments really implement the 1997 anti-bribery convention.
Regrettably, too few companies have so far followed these good practices.
Recognize alarm signals and watch out for risks  That corruption and/or extortion by tactless civil servants or other persons can take various forms and cause difficulties to companies is abundantly clear from the following examples.
Consequently it's important to detect the warning signs at an early stage in order to minimize the risks as much as possible.
A few dollars inside my passport make sure I incur no risk of having to stay an hour longer at the airport while the authorities there check my papers.
My Purchasing Director has concluded a secret agreement with a supplier, who is systematically selected to provide the products which I deliver to my branches.
There are two possibilities: I discreetly give this director the push, so that he has a field day with the competition, or I take legal action against him, without fear of publicity.
My company should demonstrate that it is committed to the price I charge the consumer, without unnecessary and counter-productive commission.
I know that the leaders of a certain country cream something off payments for the supply of commodities.
Should I co-operate with my colleagues from other countries to show them that these practices belong to the past?
No-one obliges me to do business with them.
I go to a sunny destination (Madrid/Rome/San Francisco) with the director of a public institution for my latest product launch.
We spend the whole week on the tests.
Why don't I invite him/her to view my new equipment in the nearest Belgian factory?
You should also bear in mind some possible penalties, in addition to criminal prosecution, which you may incur if you act this way.
The World Bank may add you to a blacklist of companies and/or individuals, which it consults in connection with various markets which receive subsidies or development aid.
The European Union may suspend payments of subsidies to the programme with which you co-operate.
You should not forget, either, that corruption can be infectious.
If it becomes known in your company that you are bribing officials, this increases the temptation to embezzle the company's assets or succumb to bribery in individuals' own fields of activity.
The converse is also true if an example of ethical behaviour is set.
Once corrupt, always corrupt?
If you compromise yourself by fraud, you end up in a vulnerable position: when there is no way back, it becomes difficult to stop paying slush money without exposing yourself to blackmail.
In the event of a commercial dispute, resulting in termination of a contract, it is not possible to reclaim amounts which, by law, do not exist...  Take action: what can a company do in practice?
Find out for yourself  Keeping informed is a good start.
Information is the first and best weapon in the effort which companies should make daily to combat corrupt business practices.
This brochure lists some Belgian and international websites which supplement this information.
For example, take a look at the ICC Rules of Conduct and Recommendations for Combating Extortion and Bribery, compiled by the ICC, an employers' organization.
These can be described as a method of self-regulation, in which the basic rules of prevention of corruption by companies are explained.
Although they have no legal status, these ICC Rules of Conduct outline the most sound business practices.
These Rules of Conduct make it easier for companies to fulfil their statutory obligations and responsibilities.
The ICC also has another important tool at its disposal: Fighting Corruption: International Corporate Integrity Handbook.
This ICC publication (No.
678, 2008 edition) seeks to help international companies obey the ICC Rules and act on the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
The ICC in Belgium has also published French and Dutch versions of a brochure: 'Hoe corruptie voorkomen?'
/ 'Comment prévenir la corruption?'.
The brochure is a practical guide to businesses facing attempted corruption.
Its suggestions to companies include establishing a code of conduct and briefing their employees about it.
The website of the NGO, Transparency International, lists examples of corporate initiatives against corruption: the Transparency International Business Principles for major international companies and the SME edition for small and medium-sized enterprises11.
The Belgian Network of Transparency International also holds courses and can provide advice on combating corruption.
Another invaluable source of information is the Fighting Corruption through Collective Action Guide, available at the website of the World Bank.
Take action It is important not to stand back in the fight against corruption.
Do take action, both preventive and reactive.
Think about strategy for tackling corruption in your department or company.
What are your weak points?
On what front do you run risks, and how do you think you might cope with delicate situations?
So you should be able to make sound decisions, with sufficient time for reflection, and without having to meet a crisis situation head-on.
Your measures should depend on your company's size and the degree of its exposure to such risk countries or sectors.
If you control all areas of your small business, the risk is therefore smaller.
If you are already aware of corruption-related issues, you should also raise the awareness of your staff.
Ways of doing this include codes of conduct and transparent procurement and market procedures.
Other methods are to identify posts which entail corruption risks and screen candidates for these carefully.
Hold regular integrity courses with your staff.
Allocate and pay your staff an adequate salary, anticipating future trends.
You might draw up a checklist of risks of bribery inherent to your company's business, write a manual of best practices, a code of conduct, etc.
Another powerful tool against corruption is to provide systematic protection for people who report facts within your company.
The main NGO dealing with corruption is called - aptly enough - transparency International.
Corruption occurs behind closed doors.
That is why clear procedures and the principle of double-checking are important.
Rotation of the most exposed positions may also be set up.
Watch out Finally, ensure that the established procedures and your set rules of good management are followed.
If they are not implemented in practice, your efforts will soon become redundant.
If problems occur, seek help and advice via the established channels: your trade organization, your trade union, the Federation of Enterprises in Belgium (FEB), the Chamber of Commerce, the (police and judicial) authorities, etc.
Please don't forget: your co-operation is very important to us.
The departments of government cannot act alone in the fight against corruption.
What is Belgium doing against corruption?
At international level  The internationalization of trade and the expansion of the European Union have led to growing realization that corruption is a phenomenon which needs to be tackled internationally.
That is why there is support for Community rules which adopt a cross-border approach to corruption.
This means that penalties are no longer limited to one's own national officials and/or persons and companies, but also apply to corruption of foreign officials and/or persons and companies.
Belgian companies which are engaged on the international market must therefore be aware that corrupt behaviour will not be tolerated either in domestic or international trade.
They have to realize that they may be held criminally liable for corrupt practices abroad as well.
The main international initiatives and processes are summarized below.
The United Nations Convention against Corruption, of 31 October 2003, came into force in December 2005.
This is the first global instrument in the fight against corruption.
It includes provisions concerning preventive measures, the penalization of corruption, international co-operation and technical support.
The Convention enjoys broad support: more than 100 member-countries have ratified it, including Belgium.
The United Nations Global Compact brings together nearly 5000 companies and organizations from all over the world.
Their members undertake to apply principles in the fields of human rights, work, the environment and combating of corruption to their activities and strategies.
The members report annually on the implementation of these principles.
A Belgian network has recently been established.
The 1999 Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption contains provisions on both active and passive corruption in the public and private sectors.
Belgium ratified this Convention in 2004, and also belongs to GRECO (the Group of States against Corruption), which monitors application of the Convention in the Member States.
The Council of Europe Civil Law Convention on Corruption, likewise of 1999, deals with the civil aspects of corruption.
Belgium ratified this Convention in 2007.
The 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions is very important to Belgium's private sector.
The aim of the OECD Convention is to create a common framework and a level playing field for companies to compete in the countries which ratify the Convention.
The Convention focuses on active corruption.
It penalizes people who bribe a foreign official, including in countries which are not party to the Convention.
There is also a strict evaluation mechanism within the OECD, which checks the countries for implementation and enforcement of the Convention.
The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are recommendations aimed at companies with a view to socially responsible action.
They contain a number of voluntary principles and standards for responsible behaviour in business relations.
The European Union has passed two directives (2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC) on combating corruption and the consequences of corruption.
Businesses which are convicted of bribery can be debarred from participation in public invitations to tender in other countries.
A number of EU Member States have already set up blacklists in relation to public contracts.
Other international regulations and initiatives or foreign legislation may also be important to Belgian companies.
Noteworthy initiatives in this regard are the World Bank's Collective Action initiative (www.fightingcorruption.org), the 1996 WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) and the USA's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Belgian companies may be subject to the latter US legislation if, for example, they co-operate with an American company as part of a joint venture.
At national level Since the late 1990s, Belgium has paid increasing attention to its anti-corruption policy.
A number of national corruption scandals, and inadequate legal means of combating them, have forced Belgium to revise its penalties for bribery.
International pressure has also been brought to bear.
Hence Belgium has ratified the conventions at UN and EU levels, and signed and ratified those of the Council of Europe and OECD.
Of course, signing and ratifying such conventions are not window-dressing: they require Belgium to fulfil a number of obligations.
In the late 1990s Belgium passed the Law against Bribery.
It also introduced criminal liability of legal persons.
Since then, Belgium has had firm legislation against both public and private bribery.
It has created the opportunity to prosecute and convict legal as well as natural persons.
These two laws represented the first important steps in Belgium's anti-corruption policy.
Belgium has its own, specialized anti-corruption department within the Federal Criminal Investigation Police.
This is the Central Office for the Repression of Corruption, answerable to the Directorate for Combating Economic and Financial Crime.
The Central Office is authorized to investigate, and support the investigation of, malpractices detrimental to the interests of the state.
This includes serious and complex misdemeanours involving corruption.
The Central Office also fulfils a pilot role in the context of combating criminal abuses and misconduct with regard to government contracts, subsidy laws, recognitions and licensing.
Its brief also extends to private corruption.
The Central Office monitors the phenomenon of corruption to gain the clearest possible picture of it.
The Belgian Federal Government also maintains regular contacts with counterpart foreign or international bodies, including OLAF, the European Commission's anti-fraud office.
In Belgium, the Office for Administrative Ethics and Deontology of the Federal Government Department of the Budget and Management Control implements integrity policy within the departments of the Federal Government.
This Office's task is preventive monitoring of the integrity of Federal Government departments.
The Office has now set up a framework of good practice for federal civil servants.
The primary purpose of this framework is to preserve and strengthen public trust in the proper functioning of the Federal Civil Service, by encouraging all civil servants to behave ethically and in accordance with good practice.
The private sector has made its own efforts in recent years.
Examples are the unremitting work of organizations such as the FEB, the Belgian Network of Transparency International and ICC Belgium to raise companies' awareness of these problems.
These organizations fully support companies which wish to continue to work towards ethical enterprise in a climate of globalization.
There is also an inter-departmental working group in the Service for Criminal Policy, which exists to follow up and implement the recommendations of the OECD, GRECO and the UN concerning corruption.
The working group brings together the main partners in Belgian anti-corruption policy.
Furthermore, a Network of Expertise on Corruption has been set up under the auspices of the Board of Public Prosecutors-General.
It co-operates very closely with the Network of Expertise on Economic, Financial and Fiscal Crime, bringing together partners in corruption prosecution policy.
In any case, there is a need for information exchange and contacts between the preventive and reactive arms.
This should take place in a more structured, institutionalized way.
A bridge is also being built between the public and private levels.
The private sector should be made more aware of the misdemeanour of corruption, and all kinds of ethically unacceptable behaviour.
This is a role which the public sector should fulfil: hence this brochure.
This multi-disciplinary, integrated method of working against corruption is gradually beginning to bear fruit.
Thus the inter-departmental working group, mentioned above, has prompted the amendment of the laws on bribery.
Its members have each contributed their own expertise in preparing the new act, the Law of 11 May 2007 in Amendment of the Law against Bribery.
Gradually, the doors are opening for consultation between all policy, from federal to regional.

For the Council  The President  M. ALLIOT-MARIE Protecting the EU's financial interests - fight against fraud  Since 1995, a convention has been in place which seeks to protect, under criminal law, the financial interests of the EU and its taxpayers.
Over the years, the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests has been supplemented by a series of protocols.
ACT  Council Act of 26 July 1995 drawing up the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests  SUMMARY  Since 1995, a convention has been in place which seeks to protect, under criminal law, the financial interests of the EU and its taxpayers.
Over the years, the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests has been supplemented by a series of protocols.
WHAT DOES THE CONVENTION DO?
The Convention and its protocols  provide a harmonised legal definition of fraud      require their signatories to adopt criminal penalties for fraud.
KEY POINTS  EU countries must introduce effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties to deal with fraud affecting the EU's financial interests.
The Convention differentiates between fraud in regard to expenditure and revenue.
Examples of fraud in respect to expenditure include any intentional act or omission such as: the use or presentation of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documents which has as its effect; the misappropriation or wrongful retention of funds from the EU's budget non-disclosure of information in violation of a specific obligation with the same effect; or the misapplication of such funds for purposes other than those for which they were intended.
Examples of fraud in respect of revenue include any intentional act or omission such as: the use or presentation of false, incorrect or incomplete statements or documents, which has as its effect the illegal reduction of EU budget resources; non-disclosure of information in violation of a specific obligation with the same effect; or the misapplication of a legally obtained benefit (for example, the misuse of legally obtained tax payments) with the same effect.
In cases of serious fraud, these penalties must include custodial sentences that may give rise to extradition in certain cases.
The first Protocol to the Convention, adopted in 1996, differentiates between 'active'* and 'passive'* corruption of public officials.
It also defines an 'official' (both at national and EU levels) and harmonises the penalties for corruption offences.
Liability of legal persons  Each EU country must enact legislation to allow heads of businesses or any persons having power to take decisions or exercise control within a business (i.e.
legal persons) to be declared criminally liable.
The Second Protocol, adopted in 1997, further clarified the Convention regarding the issues of the liability of legal persons, confiscation and money laundering.
National courts  In 1996, a Protocol conferring an interpretative jurisdiction on the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was adopted.
This protocol allows national courts, when in doubt as to how to interpret the Convention and its Protocols, to petition the Court of Justice of the European Union for preliminary rulings.
Each EU country must take the necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction over the offences it has established in accordance with its obligations under the convention.
Cases of fraud involving two or more countries  If a fraud constitutes a criminal offence and concerns at least two EU countries, those countries must cooperate effectively in the investigation, the prosecution and the enforcement of the penalties imposed by means, for example, of mutual legal assistance, extradition, transfer of proceedings or enforcement of sentences passed in another EU country.
Disputes between EU countries  Where disputes arise as to the interpretation or application of the Convention, the case must first be examined by the Council.
If the Council does not find a solution within 6 months, a party to the dispute may petition the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The Court of Justice also has jurisdiction over disputes between EU countries and the European Commission.
SINCE WHEN HAS THE CONVENTION APPLIED?
The Convention entered into force on 17 October 2002, along with its first protocol and the protocol on its interpretation by the Court of Justice.
The second protocol entered into force on 19 May 2009.
The convention and its protocols are open for signature by any country that joins the EU.

BUILDING UP AN ANTI-CORRUPTION CULTURE IN THE EU INSTITUTIONS  Tackling corruption and fraud within the EU institutions and bodies has become an absolute priority for the EU in the last years.
The crisis triggered by the Commission's resignation in March 1999 revealed the necessity to set up more effective measures for the protection of the integrity of the European Public Administration.
In order to improve the legal framework in this field, the Commission has defined various initiatives in its overall strategy for the protection of the Community financial interests of 2000, its action plan 2001-2003, and more recently, its evaluation report on the OLAF activities.
Based upon a thorough scrutiny of existing rules and practices, several documents pointed out the weakness of the legal framework, and especially the fact that no investigation on alleged cases of corruption or fraud could be carried out within the EU institutions.
See Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the Commission's services specifically involved in the fight against fraud, notably UCLAF (OJ C 230, 22/7/1998).
See Committee of Independent Experts, report of 15 March 1999 on fraud, mismanagement and favoritism in the European Commission, followed by a second report, dated 10 September 1999, on the reform of the Commission, analysis of practices in force and proposals to remedy mismanagement, irregularities and fraud.
Communication on the fight against fraud, for an overall strategic approach COM(2000) 358 final and Communication on the fight against fraud, Action plan 2001-2003 COM(2001) 254 final.
Created in 1999 as an independent administrative body OLAF is entrusted to investigate cases of corruption, fraud and other serious professional misconduct affecting EC budget within all EU institutions and bodies (internal investigations).
The interinstitutional agreement of May 1999 extended further the scope of its investigation power to all activities affecting Community interests against irregular conduct liable to give rise to administrative or criminal proceedings of the EC public servants.
The Cologne European Council asked all the institutions and bodies to join the interinstitutional agreement so that the investigations would be carried out under equivalent conditions in all of them.
Interinstitutional agreement between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament concerning internal investigations carried out by the Office (OJ L 136, 31/5/1999, p. 15) and model Decision annexed.
According to Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (OJ L 136, 31/5/1999, p. 1 and 8), the purpose of OLAF's investigations is fighting fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the European Community" and "investigating to that end serious matters relating to the discharge of professional duties such as to constitute a dereliction of the obligations of officials and other servants of the Communities liable to result in disciplinary or, as the case may be, criminal proceedings, or an equivalent failure to discharge obligations on the part of members ... or members of the staff of institutions, bodies, offices or agencies not subject to the Staff Regulations ...".
In order to assure a better protection of the European Public Administration integrity all the institutions and bodies should accede to interinstitutional agreement of May 1999 and adopt an internal decision in line with the model decision annexed to the interinstitutional agreement.
See recommendation n°1 of the Commission report, Evaluation of the activities of the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF), COM(2003) 154.
OLAF acts principally on the basis of referral of cases and using information supplied by the members and staff of the institutions fulfilling their duty of loyalty.
In this respect, the Commission recommends that OLAF develop practices to secure compliance with and the standardised application of information procedures to institutions and bodies concerned and information procedures to persons involved in the investigations.
The duty to communicate cases of fraud or corruption is laid down in the regulation 1073/1999.
See recommendation n°16 of the Commission report, Evaluation of the activities of the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF).
The cooperation between OLAF and other EU institutions and bodies as well as the authorities specialising in financial irregularities has also been designed as an important issue for combating corruption and fraud within EU institutions.
See Commission report, Evaluation of the activities of the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF)  Further to its White Paper on Reform, the Commission has drafted a practical guide for sound financial management describing standards of conduct, with reference to the fundamental ethical obligations provided in the Staff Regulations, in particular the duties of integrity, loyalty and impartiality.
The Commission has also introduced internal measures with a view to promoting accountability and preventing corrupt practices within the Commission such as the Decision of 4 April 2002 on raising concerns about serious wrongdoings, Codes of Conduct for Commissioners and Commission staff, standards for internal control within the Commission's services, a Guide to testing for vulnerability to fraud or new rules on job rotation for sensitive posts.
White Paper on Reforming the Commission of 1 March 2000, COM(2000) 200/2.
See Action 92, For sound project management, Practical guide.
The draft is to be submitted for approval by the full Commission.
In the framework of the reform, the Commission proposes to include rules applying to staff of all EU institutions on raising concerns about serious wrongdoings in the future Staff Regulations, which are presently under discussion in the Council.
Code of good administrative behaviour for staff of the European Commission in their relations with the public  With the creation of the Investigation and Disciplinary Office (IDOC), the Commission has set up a system, which better addresses corruption or generally conflict of interest situations from a disciplinary point of view.
The cooperation between IDOC and OLAF should be considered as essential issue in assuring an efficient and uniform protection of the integrity of the European Public Administration.
Taking into account their complementary missions in the field of administrative investigation, a memorandum of understanding should organise their relations and both guarantee appropriate follow-up of the OLAF enquiries when requiring disciplinary sanctions and avoid overlapping in their competencies.
THE OLAF HAS BROADER INTERNAL POWER TO CARRY OUT INVESTIGATIONS, EVEN INTO MEMBERS OR PERSONNEL NOT SUBJECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS, WHICH IT CAN EXERCISE IN ALL INSTITUTIONS AND BODIES.
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE OLAF EXPERTISE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST BEHAVIOUR INVOLVING SERIOUS FORMS OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OFFENCES, THIS MEMORANDUM SHOULD MAKE THE PRACTICAL BREAKDOWN OF TASKS BETWEEN OLAF AND DISCIPLINARY BODIES MORE TRANSPARENT.
SEE RECOMMENDATION 8 OF THE COMMISSION EVALUATION REPORT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE.
6.
PREVENTING CORRUPTION - THE SINGLE MARKET AND OTHER INTERNAL POLICIES  The Commission believes that future initiatives should focus on preventive measures with a view to reducing opportunities for corrupt behaviour by avoiding conflicts of interest and introducing systematic checks and controls.
This was also the approach in the Commission's first Communication on corruption.
In response to the Communication, the European Parliament called upon the Commission to exercise its power in different areas such as tax deductibility, blacklisting regarding public procurement procedures, financial transactions, training programmes, fraud within the EU institutions, money laundering and external aid and assistance.
a) Raising integrity in the public sector  On 7 November 2000, EU Ministers in charge of Civil Service and Public Administration adopted in Strasbourg a resolution on quality and benchmarking of public services in the European Union.
The cornerstone of this resolution is the setting-up of a self-assessment framework of total quality management in public services (so-called "Cadre d'Auto-évaluation des Fonctions publiques" or Common Assessment Framework, CAF).
The CAF is supposed to serve both as a means of communication and as a tool for benchmarking among EU Member States' public administrations with a view to raising integrity, accountability and transparency in public institutions  At the request of Ministers, Directors-general of Civil Service and Public Administrations have developed a work programme for the "innovative public services group" aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of administrations on a continuous basis.
The Commission therefore recommends engaging a comprehensive dialogue within the EU on minimum standards and benchmarks in administrative integrity and good governance on the basis of the Strasbourg Resolution, essential to prevent and to combat effectively organised and transborder corruption.
b) Tax Deductibility of bribes  Further to a recommendation of the OECD of 1996 and the Commission's 1997 Communication, all EU Member States that still allowed or tolerated the tax deductibility of bribes paid to foreign public officials have amended their legislation with a view to banning this possibility.
c) Public Procurement  Public procurement represents about 15 % of the GDP in the EU.
The Community directives on public procurement ensure transparency and non-discriminatory access to procurement opportunities.
The prevention of fraud, corruption and collusion between the tenderers and contracting authorities is taken into consideration in the Community system.
Collusive behaviour between companies participating in a tender moreover may constitute a direct infringement of the prohibition laid down in article 81 of the EC Treaty.
In the aforesaid Millennium Strategy, the Council has called on Member States and the European Commission to ensure that the applicable legislation provides for the possibility that an applicant in a public tender procedure who has committed offences connected with organised crime can be excluded from the participation in tender procedures conducted by Member States and the Community; specific provisions relating to the role of the Commission both in administrative co-operation and the setting up of black-lists, should be drawn up to ensure that these commitments can be carried out, while ensuring conformity with the relevant rules relating to data protection.
In its draft amendment of the public procurement directives, submitted in May 2000, the Commission inserted an obligation to exclude any tenderer who has been convicted by definitive judgement for corruption, fraud or participation in the activities of a criminal organisation.
Article 45 of the modified proposal for a directive provides for a possibility for a contracting authority to ask for the cooperation of the competent authorities of another Member State when they need to obtain information concerning the personal situation of the candidates or tenderers concerned.
The authority contacted in another Member State is obliged to cooperate upon request.
Both the Council and the European Parliament in their first reading of the proposed directive have supported the amendments to article 45.
Therefore no further legislative proposal is needed in order to start implementing article 45 of the proposed directive.
The Commission will reassess this issue in the light of the application of the new rules.
d) Raising Integrity in the private sector  i.
Protection of vulnerable professions against influences of crime  An open and fruitful dialogue has started with representatives of the legal professions, accountants and auditors, in order to identify possible gaps or inconsistencies, develop basic ethical principles at EU level and strike the right balance between professional secrecy and public interest.
As a result, a Charter of the European professional associations in support of the fight against crime was signed on 27 July 1999.
The European professional associations (notaries, lawyers, accountants, auditors and tax consultants) encourage their Member Associations to adopt standards within the existing or future Codes of conduct to protect the professionals they represent from being involved in fraud, corruption and money laundering or from being exploited by organised crime.
The Commission invites the signatories of the Charter of the European professional associations in support of the fight against crime to further strengthen their self-regulatory regimes.
This with a view to reducing the risk that representatives of these professions should sacrifice their professional integrity as a result of acts performed by criminals for illicit purposes.
ii.
Strengthening corporate social responsibility  Companies and their representatives are usually both offenders of corrupt practices (supply side of corruption) and victims (either as an unselected bidder, because a contract was awarded to a competitor using bribes to influence the decision to their favour or as victims where an employee has acted against the company's interests because he or she was bribed by a competing company).
This double-faced role of the private sector has to be addressed through promoting corporate responsibility and liability on the basis of international standards and principles, including the development and implementation of modern accounting standards, adoption of adequate internal audit schemes, codes of conduct and their implementation, and the establishment of channels for communication  Further to the adoption of the 1997 OECD Convention on bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions, it is a punishable offence (including corporate liability) in all state parties' jurisdictions (including all EU Member States) to bribe a foreign public official of any jurisdiction world-wide.
Still, recent studies (cf.
Bribe Payers' Index of Transparency International) seem to indicate that only few companies are aware of this international instrument and national implementing legislation.
Awareness raising within the entire private sector should be improved with a view to sensitising companies to the damaging consequences that corrupt practices might have on companies and their reputation and thus preventing corruption.
Bribery is a hidden phenomenon because it is built on "the pact of silence" between briber and bribee.
Companies should therefore have clear rules on "whistleblowing" (i.e.
procedures to follow if an employee becomes aware of corrupt behaviour inside the company).
This should include training and monitoring of these rules with a view to making it clear that corruption is unacceptable, and encouraging employees to expose it.
The Commission intends to further stimulate the necessary dialogue in this area between the public and the private sector through initiatives such as the EU Forum on the prevention of organised crime.
e) Accounting standards and statutory audit  In the area of accounting and auditing, major recent scandals have led to an acceleration of decision-making with a view to creating an efficient and competitive EU capital market by 2005, which is the objective of the EU's "Financial Services Action Plan".
In June 2002, the EU adopted a regulation requiring listed companies, including banks and insurance companies, to prepare their consolidated accounts in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) from 2005 onwards.
This will ensure that company accounts throughout the EU are more reliable, transparent and more easily comparable.
This will also facilitate the detection of fraud and corruption.
Now, the Commission has to ensure proper implementation, harmonised interpretation and enforcement of the IAS.
In May 2002, the Commission has issued Recommendations on the independence of the statutory auditor.
The recommendations contain a set of demanding principles.
They recommend in particular that auditors should be prohibited from carrying out a statutory audit if they have any relationship with the client that might compromise their independence.
Although recommendations are not legally binding, they will serve as a clear benchmark of best practice.
The Commission will monitor implementation and will consider, in the light of practical application, whether binding EU legislation may be required.
At present there are no agreed auditing standards in the EU.
Although there is general agreement that any initiative in this field should be based on the International Standards on Auditing (ISA), it is still unclear how all statutory audits in the EU will be carried out on this basis.
There is also no EU mechanism to deal with supervision of the audit profession.
Statutory audit will be subject of a forthcoming communication of the Commission outlining future policy priorities in this field.
f) Fighting corruption in bodies of special nature in-between the public and the private sector  In recent years, Western Europe has been hit by a wave of political corruption scandals.
They have highlighted that there may be secret (triangular) links between public office holders, the business world and representatives of social partners and other interest groups, somewhat in-between the public and the private sector, such as political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, or foundations, etc.
Very often undeclared donations are given to these semi-public entities of special nature, often circumventing legal obligations, to influence important political or economic decisions or to create a "good climate" between the public and the private sector.
The secret nature of these links usually makes it very difficult to prove concrete quid-pro-quo bribe giving and bribe taking in a criminal law sense and sometimes the behaviour is not punishable at all.
In particular, a handful of high-profile cases disclosed by the media has highlighted this phenomenon.
This trend can be broadly linked to the structure and rules of the financing of social partners and other interest groups within the countries concerned.
This growth in political scandals linked to the financing of these entities is due in part to the following factors: growing bureaucratisation of organisations, increasing costs of campaign expenditures, a change in the nature of political competition through greater use of the media or the declining role of the state as a public service provider and competition for state contracts.
As such, a major review is needed that assesses and analyses the nature of these links so as to expose the problem and address it in the future.
In fact, only utmost transparency in financing of social partners and interest groups, election spending and certain restrictions on business activities of representatives of these entities can ensure that they act free of (potential) conflicts of interests.
The Commission is very concerned about this development and suggests the EU-wide adoption of clear and transparent rules on the financing of these entities of special nature and an increasing role of the civil society.
On the basis of a study assessing the situation of political corruption and financing of social partner entities and other interest groups in Europe, the Commission will prepare and submit proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council containing standards and best practices for transparent funding of these entities, election spending and avoiding of conflicts of interest.
7.
EXTERNAL ASPECTS  The forthcoming accession of new EU Members States and a stronger coherence between internal and external EU policy as suggested in the Tampere conclusions or in the recent "Communication on Wider Europe - Neighbourhood", with a particular focus on Russia, Western NIS, South-East Europe and the Mediterranean Partners already pave the way for future (concentrated) EU initiatives in the fight against corruption.
a) Encouraging anti-corruption policies in the acceding, candidate and other third countries on the basis of 10 general principles (cf.
attached to this document)  In the EU acceding and candidate countries the fight against corruption has become much more prominent during recent years, particularly driven by the prospect of accession.
Although enormous progress has already been achieved and the majority of these countries have adopted national anti-corruption strategies, corruption, and other economic crimes remain prevalent as highlighted by the Commission in its regular progress reports on accession.
Moreover, overlapping jurisdictions and lack of co-ordination endanger the achievements.
Although capacity building in the fight against corruption was addressed during the accession negotiations and the PHARE programme has supported several anti-corruption projects, the Commission proposes that efforts should be intensified to ensure that its overall anti-corruption strategy is fully extended to acceding and candidate countries.
Although all acceding and candidate countries have signed at least one of the relevant international anti-corruption instruments, such as the Criminal and the Civil Law Conventions of the Council of Europe or the OECD Convention on bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions, the biggest challenge remains their effective implementation.
The Commission has frequently recommended improved co-ordination between different authorities responsible for fighting corruption and further campaigns to raise public awareness in order to prevent corruption.
The establishment of a single anti-corruption unit or a single co-ordinating body would represent a significant step forward in this respect.
The capacity of public administration structures and the judiciary to perform their tasks effectively is an overarching concern of the Commission.
This holds in particular for the implementation of legal obligations derived from the acquis.
In order to render the fight against corruption effective, the enhanced integrity, transparency and accountability of administrations and the promotion of good governance constitute essential elements of a comprehensive preventative policy.
The Commission favours, on the basis of ten general principles (cf.
attached to this document) and the needs of each particular country, a comprehensive effort of the Phare programme in the remaining time-frame prior to accession with a view to further strengthening relevant administrative capacities (judiciary, police, customs, public procurement) in the candidate countries.
The Commission considers that training and specialisation in this field should be improved in order to provide the national bodies in all relevant areas such as judiciary, prosecution, law enforcement, customs and police with appropriate and well-trained staff.
Above all the most comprehensive and central recommendation in this context is an enhanced alignment of national legislation with the acquis and other international instruments to ensure further development.
The Commission fully recognises that the effectiveness of national anti-corruption policies can be only assessed at least one year after their implementation.
In other countries, such as the states of the Western Balkans, corruption remains a widespread phenomenon.
A general strengthening of the national institution is a key element of the Stabilisation and Association process in the Western Balkan countries.
Stronger and more effective institutions will have a better capacity to resist corruption.
Addressing corruption is an important part of regional and country strategies set up in the context of the CARDS assistance programme with regard to, for example, fighting organised crime.
In general, progress in eliminating corruption is essential if the countries of the western Balkans are to advance further on their way towards European integration.
In December 2002, the Copenhagen European Council confirmed that the Union should take the opportunity offered by enlargement to enhance relations with its neighbours, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and the Mediterranean countries, to avoid drawing new dividing lines in Europe and to promote stability and prosperity within and beyond the new borders of the Union.
Within the new Neighbourhood Policy, it is foreseen to intensify cooperation to prevent and combat common security threats, including corruption.
The EU will explore possibilities to work more closely with the neighbouring countries on judicial and police cooperation and the development of mutual legal assistance.
These countries need to attract foreign investment in order to boost economic performance.
This provides strong indirect incentives to reduce levels of corruption, and politicians have increasingly shown awareness of this fact.
b) Cooperation agreements and foreign aid programmes  The promotion of human rights, the consolidation of democratic principles and the rule of law have become key objectives of the foreign and development policy of the EU.
They have been integrated as "essential elements" in the different co-operation agreements with developing countries and are part of the regular political dialogue with partner countries.
The ACP-EU Partnership Agreement signed in Cotonou the 23 June 2000 between the EU and 77 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries goes one step further by explicitly addressing the issues of good governance (as "fundamental element") and corruption.
The ACP and EU agreed on a definition of good-governance that includes the fight against corruption.
These areas are also an important subject for political dialogue.
The parties have agreed that, when the Community is a significant partner in terms of financial support, serious cases of corruption, including acts of bribery leading to such corruption, can give rise to a consultation procedure.
If the measures to remedy the situation are not taken, the suspension of the co-operation can be decided as a measure of last resort.
Good governance is the transparent and accountable management of human, natural, economic and financial resources for the purpose of equitable and sustainable development.
It entails clear decision-making procedures at the level of public authorities, transparent and accountable institutions, the primacy of the rule of law in the management of resources and capacity building for elaborating and implementing measures aiming in particular to preventing and combating corruption  The Cotonou Agreement does not define the "serious cases of corruption" that can lead to the suspension of the co-operation.
In the framework of the permanent political dialogue that covers governance-related issues, the parties examine the changes underway and the continuity of the progresses achieved.
This regular assessment takes into account each country's economic, social, cultural and historical context.
The consultation procedure does not apply exclusively or necessarily when EC funds are involved but more generally when corruption constitutes an obstacle to the country's development.
Consultations have taken place in one case, when the European Union were deeply preoccupied by the lack of transparency in the public accounting system and by the risks of serious corruption in particular in the management of natural resources and the exploitation of monopolies in a partner country.
The Commission's Manual of Instructions on Contracts for works, supplies and services concluded for the purposes of Community co-operation with third countries contains provisions that apply to cases of corrupt practices detected in the context of a particular project.
These provisions do not necessarily involve the suspension of the application of the Co-operation framework with the country concerned.
They affect in general, at least at a first stage, EC disbursements for supporting this particular project.
Section 7 of the Manual provides for the possibility to "suspend or cancel project financing if corrupt practices of any kind are discovered at any stage of the award process and if the contracting authority fails to take all appropriate measures to remedy the situation.
For the purposes of this provision, 'corrupt practices' are the offer of a bribe, gift, gratuity or commission to any person as an inducement or reward for performing or refraining from any act relating to the award of a contract or implementation of a contract already concluded with the contracting authority."
In order to implement this new policy, the Commission is currently reviewing its framework and specific financing agreements with beneficiary states as well as its tender documents and contracts with a view to inserting standard clauses clarifying that the Commission may cancel financing and making the beneficiary state responsible for taking concrete actions in cases of corruption.
More recently (December 2001, January 2002) agreements were concluded with Algeria and Lebanon containing new chapters dedicated to cooperation in the Justice and Home Affairs area.
They include a specific article on the fight against corruption and refer to existing international legal instruments and commit the parties to take concrete measures against corruption and grant mutual legal assistance in criminal enquiries.
c) EU Trade Policy and Officially Supported Export Credits  Recent studies examining the connection between the openness of a country and good governance on the one hand, and the degree of corruption on the other hand, suggest that the best corruption prevention strategy seems to be a high investment in institution-building ("good governance"), well-paid civil servants and participation in free trade and provision of open markets: the more open a country is, the less prone will it be to corruption.
By increasing uncertainty and the costs of transactions, corruption hampers international trade and reduces investment and therefore growth.
Open, transparent and competitive market conditions locally and at the international level can reduce corruption.
The EU, through the Commission, has consistently sought transparency as an essential element in international trade.
In this context, it has always recognised the need for increased transparency in government procurement as one of its highest priorities.
The EC promotes the extension to other WTO Parties of the Agreement on Government Procurement, which contains provisions of enhanced transparency and ensures fair competition in international procurement.
The EC is also committed to engage actively in the envisaged negotiations for a multilateral agreement on transparency in government procurement as agreed in the Doha WTO 4th Ministerial Conference.
Its proposals in other rule making areas of the WTO Doha agenda to improve the transparency and predictability of the multilateral systems will, if implemented, also improve levels of integrity.
Concerning officially supported export credits, the Commission invites Member States to monitor concrete implementation of anti-corruption clauses in the rules applied by relevant national agencies and in line with the OECD "Action Statement" of December 2000.
8.
CONCLUSIONS  In conclusion, the future EU policy on corruption should consist of the following core elements:  * A strong political commitment against all forms of corruption should come from the highest level of EU institutions.
* The implementation of existing anti-corruption instruments should be closely monitored and strengthened for the time being through the adhesion of the European Community to one or both Conventions on Corruption of the Council of Europe and the participation in its monitoring mechanism GRECO.
* EU Member States should develop and improve investigative tools and allocate more specialised staff to the fight against corruption.
* Member States and EU institutions and bodies should enhance efforts to combat corruption damaging the financial interests of the European Community.
* Common integrity standards in public administrations across the EU such as the Common Assessment Framework of EU Heads of Civil Service and Public Administration should be further developed at EU level.
* Member States and the Commission should support the private sector in its efforts to raise integrity and corporate responsibility.
* The fight against political corruption and illicit financing of social partner entities and other interest groups needs to be strengthened at EU and Member States level.
* In their permanent dialogue with acceding, candidate and other third countries, the Member States and the Commission should systematically include corruption-related issues and further assist these countries in their efforts to set-up and implement national anti-corruption policies on the basis of the attached ten general principles.
* The EU should continue making the fight against corruption an integral part of its external and trade police.
ANNEX  TEN PRINCIPLES FOR IMPROVING THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ACCEDING, CANDIDATE AND OTHER THIRD COUNTRIES  1 To ensure credibility, a clear stance against corruption is essential from leaders and decision-makers.
Bearing in mind that no universally applicable recipes exist, national anti-corruption strategies or programmes, covering both preventive and repressive measures, should be drawn up and implemented.
These strategies should be subject to broad consultation at all levels.
2 Current and future EU Members shall fully align with the EU acquis and ratify and implement all main international anti-corruption instruments they are party to (UN, Council of Europe and OECD Conventions).
Third countries should sign and ratify as well as implement relevant international anti-corruption instruments.
3 Anti-corruption laws are important, but more important is their implementation by competent and visible anti-corruption bodies (i.e.
well trained and specialised services such as anti-corruption prosecutors).
Targeted investigative techniques, statistics and indicators should be developed.
The role of law enforcement bodies should be strengthened concerning not only corruption but also fraud, tax offences and money laundering.
4 Access to public office must be open to every citizen.
Recruitment and promotion should be regulated by objective and merit-based criteria.
Salaries and social rights must be adequate.
Civil servants should be required to disclose their assets.
Sensitive posts should be subject to rotation.
5 Integrity, accountability and transparency in public administration (judiciary, police, customs, tax administration, health sector, public procurement) should be raised through employing quality management tools and auditing and monitoring standards, such as the Common Assessment Framework of EU Heads of Public Administrations and the Strasbourg Resolution.
Increased transparency is important in view of developing confidence between the citizens and public administration.
6 Codes of conduct in the public sector should be established and monitored.
7 Clear rules should be established in both the public and private sector on whistle blowing (given that corruption is an offence without direct victims who could witness and report it) and reporting.
8 Public intolerance of corruption should be increased, through awareness-raising campaigns in the media and training.
The central message must be that corruption is not a tolerable phenomenon, but a criminal offence.
Civil society has an important role to play in preventing and fighting the problem.
9 Clear and transparent rules on party financing, and external financial control of political parties, should be introduced to avoid covert links between politicians and (illicit) business interests.
Political parties evidently have strong influence on decision-makers, but are often immune to anti-bribery laws.
10 Incentives should be developed for the private sector to refrain from corrupt practices such as codes of conduct or "white lists" for integer companies.Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee - On a comprehensive EU policy against corruption /* COM/2003/0317 final */   COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE - ON A COMPREHENSIVE EU POLICY AGAINST CORRUPTION  1.
INTRODUCTION  Art.
29 of the Treaty on European Union lists the prevention and combating of corruption, organised or otherwise, as one objective enabling the creation and safeguarding of a European area of freedom, security and justice through closer judicial, police and customs cooperation and, where necessary, approximation of criminal law.
Going beyond the area of pure law enforcement, the Council in its 1997 Action Plan against organised crime had already advocated a comprehensive policy against corruption, primarily focussing on preventive measures and taking into account the work carried out also in other international fora.
In particular, Member States, the Council and the Commission had been invited to also tackle all aspects linked with the proper functioning of the internal market and other internal policies, as well as external assistance and cooperation.
Responding to this political guideline, the Commission put forward in the same year a Communication to the European Parliament and to the Council suggesting a range of measures (banning of tax deductibility of bribes, rules on public procurement procedures, introduction of accounting and auditing standards, blacklisting of corrupt companies and measures in the Community's external aid and assistance scheme) with a view to formulating an EU strategy on corruption both within and outside its borders.
Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a Union policy against corruption, adopted by the Commission on 21 May 1997 COM(97) 192 final.
Focussing again on the area of judicial cooperation in criminal law matters, the 1998 Council Vienna Action Plan identified corruption as one of those criminal behaviours in the field of organised crime where prioritised action was deemed necessary by elaborating and adopting measures establishing minimum rules relating to the constituent elements of this offence and penalties.
Action plan of the Council and the Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice, adopted by the Council on 3 December 1998; OJ C of 23/01/1999 N° 19/1.
At the 1999 Tampere European Council, EU Heads of State or Government endorsed this recommendation by identifying corruption, in the context of financial crime, as one of the sectors of particular relevance where common definitions, incriminations and sanctions should be agreed upon.
Finally, in line with the 1998 Action Plan and the Tampere Conclusions, the so-called Millennium Strategy on the Prevention and Control of Organised Crime of March 2000 reiterated the need for instruments aimed at the approximation of national legislation and developing a more general (i.e.
multi-disciplinary) EU policy towards corruption, taking into account as appropriate work being carried out in international organisations.
Furthermore, the same document urged those Member States, which had not yet ratified the relevant EU and Council of Europe anti-corruption legal instruments to ensure speedy ratification within a clear timeframe.
The prevention and control of organised crime - a European Union strategy for the beginning of the new millennium adopted by the Council on 27 March 2000.
Since then the fight against corruption has gained further momentum at national, EU and international level and important EU and international instruments have been adopted.
Concerning EU instruments, the EU Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests (PIF-Convention) and its first protocol entered into force on 17 October 2002; the second protocol to the PIF-Convention and the EU Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of the EU Member States are still in the ratification process.
Also with regard to the protection of the Communities' financial interests, the Commission has been addressing in-house corruption by establishing a European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) entrusted with interinstitutional investigative powers.
On the basis of article 280 TEC, which combines measures to prevent and to combat fraud detrimental to the EC budget, an overall strategy was adopted.
This strategy defines as a challenge within the Commission four-axed policy document, a detailed interinstitutional approach to prevent and combat corruption .
With respect to OLAF internal investigations, corruption covers the professional misconduct of EU officials in relation with the exercise of their duties liable to result in disciplinary or criminal proceedings.
The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has recently been subject to an in-depth evaluation report of the Commission, notably with respect to the implementation of the objectives set out in the above mentioned strategy.
Having a comprehensive approach on tackling corruption, the present communication follows a coherent approach together with the new initiatives on the protection of the Communities' financial interests announced by this evaluation report.
The OECD Convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions and the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe are already in force, the latter still lacking ratification instruments of most EU Member States.
The Convention was signed on 21/11/1997 and entered into force on 15/02/1999.
The full text, details on ratification and implementing legislation and evaluation reports are available.
The Convention was signed on 27/01/1999 and entered into force on 01/07/2002.
The full text, details on ratification and implementing legislation and evaluation reports are available.
In 2000, the UN General Assembly decided to mandate an Ad-Hoc Committee with the elaboration of an international legal instrument against corruption, the future UN Convention against corruption.
If agreed, this will have far-reaching implications for the world-wide fight against corruption.
The EU has adopted three common positions on the basis of article 34 of the Treaty on European Union.
The Commission has substantially contributed to the common positions and was authorised by the Council to negotiate those provisions of the draft Convention relating to Community competencies.
Relevant documents of the Ad Hoc Committee for the negotiations of a United Nations Convention against Corruption are available under:  In the aforesaid recommendations, the EU Council repeatedly emphasised the need to take into account the activities of other international fora devoted to the fight against corruption.
Bearing in mind this advice and with the conviction that duplicating similar activities can bind unnecessary resources and therefore even be counterproductive, the Commission holds the view that, at this stage of policy development, mainly those measures should be strengthened and supported at EU level, which are not already substantively covered, or not with the same degree of mandatory character as EU instruments, by international organisations.
This goes in particular for initiatives of the United Nations, the OECD and the Council of Europe, where the EU has been playing a leading role and should continue to do so.
The objectives and purposes of combating corruption at EU level as referred to in article 29 TEU need to be put clearly and coherently in the context of other policy objectives resulting from the EC treaty such as sound decision making, fair competition, effective functioning of the internal market, protection of the financial interests of the European Communities, external aid and assistance, open, free and fair international trade.
A clear delimitation of the initiatives outlined in the present Communication with respect to actions in the above mentioned policy areas is necessary with a view to providing a comprehensive framework and to ensuring complementarity between the different areas.
This Communication sets out an overview of what has been achieved at EU level, but also indicates what needs to be improved to give fresh impetus to the fight against corruption.
It also seeks to identify possible areas where the EU might be an appropriate actor to take future initiatives in the fight against corruption.
It is the Commission's firm intention to reduce corruption at all levels in a coherent way within the EU institutions, in EU Member States and outside the EU, i.e.
political corruption, corrupt activities committed by and collusively with organised crime groups, private-to-private and so-called petty corruption.
As long as there is crime, the interest to use bribes as insurance against prosecution and punishment will remain and especially organised crime groups will rather reinvest a certain amount of their illicitly acquired gains into bribe-paying than running the risk of law enforcement measures against them and thus facing deprivation of liberty and the loss of their proceeds.
Yet, it can be assumed that the level and degree of corruption within our societies could be considerably diminished if repressive measures were strengthened and opportunities reduced.
To this end, corrupt acts have to be detected and prosecuted and offenders have to be punished and deprived of their illicit proceeds.
At the same time, opportunities for corrupt practices have to be reduced and potential conflicts of interest have to be prevented through transparent and accountable administrative structures at legislative, executive and judicial level as well as in the private sector.
Comprehensive integrity-enhancing strategies, exchange of best practices and institutional safeguards should ensure that decisions in the public sector are solely taken in the public interest.
2.
TERMINOLOGY  There is no single uniform definition of all the constituent elements of corruption.
Whereas one of the rather traditional definitions, followed by the World Bank and the non-governmental organisation Transparency International, views corruption as "the use of one's public position for illegitimate private gains", it appears more appropriate to use a broader definition such as the one of the Global Programme against Corruption run by the United Nations, i.e.
"abuse of power for private gain" and including thereby both the entire public and private sector.
The Civil Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe (Strasbourg 4/11/1999; European Treaty Series n°174) defines "corruption" as "requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behaviour required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof."
Given their very nature, the aforementioned EU instruments define corruption purely from a criminal law perspective criminalising a conduct, which is usually referred to as (active or passive) bribery.
Cf.
Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European, articles 2 and 3 of the first protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and articles 2 and 3 of the Joint Action on corruption in the private sector.
In the following, a distinction should be made between corruption in this narrower criminal law sense and corruption in a broader socio-economic sense.
This distinction is necessary because, in accordance with rule of law principles, criminal law provisions require unambiguous and precise language, whereas the concept of corruption can be more general while responding to the purposes of crime prevention.
In this context, the definition of corruption could embrace concepts such as integrity, transparency, accountability and good governance.
Hence, the boundaries for an EU anti-corruption policy will differ depending on the subject: Whereas the initiatives mentioned in chapters 4 and 5 rather address corruption in a narrower criminal law sense, chapters 3, 6 and 7 and the list of general principles attached to this Communication are subject of a much broader concept of corruption.
IT IS USEFUL NOTING THAT THESE PRINCIPLES ARE REFLECTED IN THE DISCIPLINARY RULES AS LAID DOWN E.G.
IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLYING TO ALL OFFICIALS AND OTHER AGENTS OF THE EU INSTITUTIONS.
3.
POLITICAL COMMITMENT - A PRIORITY  Combating and preventing corruption can only be successful when all parts of society agree that this is indispensable.
However, the most important signal has to come from leaders and decision-makers themselves.
Public agents would find it difficult to act impartially, objectively and solely in the public interest if the country's highest representatives did not promote and live up to the anti-corruption standards to be established.
Clear political determination and an unambiguous stance of EU governments and its representatives would also give a clear signal to their counterparts in those countries preparing for accession and to the rest of the world.
In this context, the Commissions recalls the underlying and common principles of the Union as stipulated in article 6 of the Treaty on European Union: liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
Whereas corruption undermines all of these principles, the unlimited respect of these common values is indeed the best safeguard against the spread of corrupt practices.
The conclusions and recommendations of this Communication should be fully endorsed by the European Council at one of its next meetings.
4.
PUTTING EFFECT TO CRIMINAL LAW INSTRUMENTS  Further to the European Council of Tampere, devoted exclusively to Justice and Home Affairs matters, the so-called Millennium Strategy on the Prevention and Control of Organised Crime of 27 March 2000 quotes corruption in the context of financial crime as one of those offences where the Council "should adopt instruments with a view to approximating the legislation of Member States" by agreeing on common definitions, incriminations and sanctions and developing a more general (i.e.
multi-disciplinary) EU policy towards these specific form of crime, taking into account as appropriate work being carried out in other international organisations (cf.
Tampere Presidency conclusion 48 and recommendation 7 of the Millennium Strategy).
a) Ratification of EU anti-corruption instruments  In its recommendation 27, the Millennium Strategy has urged those Member States, which have not yet ratified the following EU anti-corruption instruments to make proposals to their Parliaments with a view to speedy ratification within the given timetable:  (1) by mid-2001 the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests (PIF-Convention);  (2) by the end of 2001 the Protocols to the PIF-Convention;  (3) by the end of 2001 the EU Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of the EU Member States.
With the ratification of all EU Member States, the PIF-Convention and its 1st Protocol (which has for the first time legally defined active and passive corruption at EU level) entered into force on 17 October 2002.
Moreover, in May 2001 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive, which would provide for a common definition of active and passive corruption to the detriment of the Communities financial interests.
Further to the opinion of the European Parliament, who approved the text in principle at the first reading, the proposal was amended on 16 October 2002.
The Council is still examining this proposal.
The proposal aims at aligning substantive criminal law in the Member States as regards the definition of fraud, corruption and money laundering affecting Community financial interests as well as criminal liability and the criminal penalties applicable, in accordance with the PIF-Convention and its two protocols.
Whilst these instruments are limited to criminal behaviour damaging the financial interests of the European Communities, the 1997 Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union criminalises active and passive transborder corruption within the EU territory, even when Communities financial interests are not affected.
However, two EU Member States have still not completed the ratification process.
The Commission calls upon those Member States which have not yet ratified the EU Convention on Corruption and/or the 2nd Protocol to the PIF-Convention, to do so without any further delay.
b) Ratification of international anti-corruption instruments  All EU Member States have ratified the OECD Convention on bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions of 1997 and have adjusted their criminal law accordingly.
With 14 ratifications completed, the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe entered into force on 1 July 2002.
Still, only four EU Member States have ratified this Convention.
Only 2 EU Member States have ratified the Civil Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe so far.
The Commission calls upon those Member States which have not yet ratified the Criminal and/or the Civil Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe or which have not joined the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), to do so without any further delay.
c) Monitoring the implementation of anti-corruption instruments  Once these EU and international instruments will have come into force by effective enacting legislation, many of the Member States' relevant criminal law provisions (incriminations, sanctions and confiscation, liability of and sanctions for legal persons, extradition, prosecution and cooperation between Member States' law enforcement authorities) will be already assimilated.
The Commission is of the opinion that all international efforts on combating corruption can only prove their worth if they are followed by monitoring and evaluation mechanisms based on peer review.
On the other hand, (costly and often counterproductive) duplication of international activities should be avoided as much as possible.
As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission has a general role in monitoring the implementation of in particular EC law and closely following the implementation of all EU instruments by the Member States  Nevertheless, apart from the possibility to submit questions on interpretation and validity on Framework Decisions and Conventions to the European Court of Justice by way of preliminary rulings, the EU instruments do not provide a genuine follow-up monitoring or evaluating mechanism comparable to the (subregional) OECD Working Group on Bribery or the (mainly European) Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) mandated to ensure the implementation of the OECD Bribery Convention and the Council of Europe's Criminal and Civil Law Conventions.
GRECO is responsible for monitoring observance of the Council of Europe's 20 Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption and implementation of the Criminal and Civil Law Conventions on Corruption and on codes of conduct for public officials.
It evaluates in two phases through peer review, the compliance with undertakings contained in these legal instruments and thus contributes to identifying deficiencies and insufficiencies of national mechanisms against corruption, and to prompting the necessary legislative, institutional and practical reforms in order to better prevent and combat corruption.
In this context, it is useful recalling that both Council of Europe Conventions on corruption followed the adoption of the EU criminal law instruments and developed them further.
GRECO became operational as of 1 May 1999 and currently has 34 members, including all EU Member States (except Austria and Italy) and candidate countries (except Turkey) and the US.
The Commission is of the opinion that at this stage a separate EU anti-corruption evaluation and monitoring mechanism is inappropriate, because this would run against the Commission's general conviction that unnecessary duplication of efforts should be avoided.
Both Conventions on Corruption of the Council of Europe and GRECO's Statute provide already specific accession clauses for the European Community.
Whilst accession to the Criminal Law Convention and GRECO membership independent of the two Conventions requires a formal invitation by the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, the accession to the Civil Law Convention, followed automatically by GRECO membership, can be unilaterally decided by the EC.
Hence, the Commission will prepare, within the limits of Community competence, the accession of the European Community to both Conventions on Corruption of the Council of Europe and request the Council for authorisation to negotiate with the Council of Europe the terms and modalities of the Community's subsequent participation in GRECO.
EU Member States should in the Council and in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe fully support the possible application of the European Community, prepared by the Commission, to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe, including its subsequent participation in GRECO, based on the appropriate modalities to be agreed.
In case participation in GRECO will not be considered a viable option, the Commission would consider if a separate EU mutual evaluation and monitoring mechanism on the fight against corruption could be set up.
d) Improving judicial and police cooperation within the EU  Police and judicial cooperation within the EU has been strengthened through the setting-up of EUROJUST, a judicial cooperation network, and an extended mandate for Europol.
The creation of the provisional EUROJUST unit was approved in December 2001 and nomination of its members took place in July 2002.
EUROJUST is composed of one magistracy (prosecutor, judge, police officers with prosecuting powers) for each Member State with a view to facilitating contacts, enabling cooperation between magistrates and discovering links between on-going transborder cases.
The material competence of EUROJUST is very similar to the mandate of the Europol Convention covering inter alia fraud and corruption, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation.
Hence, both bodies can and will be dealing with transborder corruption cases and thus fulfil requirements stemming from relevant provisions of the EU anti-corruption instruments.
Also the European Financial Prosecutor as proposed by the Commission in its Green Paper of 11 December 2001 would be mandated to deal with corruption offences provided they affect the financial interests of the Community.
In this context, the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant, whose provisions will be applied by all Member States at the latest on 1 January 2004, will be a key factor in the fight against corruption.
The Framework Decision will include the offence of corruption among the offences for which prior verification of double criminality is not required, and this should ensure that offenders are surrendered to the judicial authorities of the requesting State.
Furthermore, the Council is currently examining proposals for two new legal acts, which once adopted, would engage Member States to adjust national legislation or adopt new provisions with a view to ensuring mutual recognition of freezing orders, including proceeds of corruption offences, and facilitating confiscation of proceeds, especially by allowing the competent authorities to confiscate property belonging to a person convicted of a criminal act "that is of such nature that it can generate substantial proceeds", unless that person can demonstrate that the property was legitimately acquired.
In the two texts, no specific predicate offences are listed; it would be applicable to all acts punishable by a maximum sentence of up to six years' imprisonment.
Albeit from a legal point of view not covering the area of judicial and police cooperation, it is useful also recalling in this context that the second Money Laundering Directive adopted in November 2001 extends the scope of predicate offences to all serious crime, including explicitly "corruption", and obliges Member States to combat and to prevent the laundering of proceeds stemming from these offences.
Actions which amount to corruption under the laws of the Member States, whether passive or active or in the private or public sectors, should be covered taking into account the common standards and definitions developed under the EU instruments and the OECD Bribery Convention and the Council of Europe Conventions on Corruption.
e) Fighting private-to-private corruption  As regards private sector corruption, a Joint Action on corruption in the private sector was adopted in December 1998, which calls on Member States to make a criminal offence of both active and passive corruption of a person acting in the course of business.
Member States may however limit themselves to cover conduct which involves the distortion of competition within the common market and which results in economic damage to others by the improper award or execution of a contract.
Still, the Joint Action only committed the Member States' governments, but not the national parliaments and indeed up to now, only eight Member States have implemented the Joint Action in its entirety.
Hence, Denmark submitted in July 2002 an initiative for a Council Framework Decision on combating private sector corruption.
It is supposed to reformat and to further develop the Joint Action of 1998 and thus have a more binding character than the previous instrument.
The Commission recalls that the aforesaid Joint Action was accompanied by a Council declaration, which was supported by the Commission, suggesting to take further steps in the future.
At their meeting on 19 December 2002, EU Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs reached a general political agreement on the text of the draft Framework Decision.
The Commission welcomes this initiative, which takes into account the process of privatisation in former public companies at large.
The suggested instrument would also ensure that there is no imbalance between the instruments covering corruption involving public officials and corruption between private entities.
Thus, independent of the organisational structure of certain sectors within the EU and taking into account that the public sector criminal law instruments refer to domestic law when defining what public officials are, possible legal discrepancies can be evened out with a view to giving the same degree of legal protection against the same corrupt behaviour.
Furthermore, the Danish initiative seeks to follow the approach chosen in other Framework Decisions.
f) Detecting, prosecuting and punishing corruption cases  Whilst substantial criminal law legislation on corruption covering both active and passive in the public and the private sector is already or will be shortly in place in all EU Member States and its candidate countries - thanks to supranational efforts in this field by drawing up the aforementioned EU and international anti-corruption instruments - the true problem of the fight against corruption seems to lie rather in the field of implementing these laws, i.e.
preventing, investigating, prosecuting and adjudicating corruption cases.
This is due to the fact that corruption is often referred to as the crime without (direct) victim.
Hence, there is rarely an affected party being able to report a corruption case to police and judicial authorities and indeed very few cases of corruption are reported.
This is probably due to the fact that corruption usually is sealed through the pact of silence between briber and bribee, who have a mutual interest in concealing their activities as far as possible.
Furthermore there are only very limited statistics and crime records on corruption cases, and those that exist do not serve as indicators of the general problem due to the high number of unreported cases.
Consequently, it is very difficult to draw the right conclusions and the only way in order to know more is to convince witnesses to report corruption cases.
This can only be achieved by the effective protection of whistleblowers against victimisation and retaliation (loss of job, personal threats etc.)
and witness protection instruments as suggested in the Millennium Strategy on the prevention and control of organised crime (cf.
Recommendation n° 25).
Often, there will be no witnesses at all that could report a corruption case, so that the only way to reveal corrupt practices seems to be to give incentives for persons directly involved in these practices to report their accomplices.
If none of these possibilities provides the right solution, one has to think, as a last resort, about ways to facilitate the burden of proof for law enforcement authorities.
The Commission Decision on raising concerns about serious wrongdoings sets out clear rules for the Commission staff on what to do and whom to contact in cases of e.g.
fraud or corruption.
Member States should, where appropriate at the proposal of the Commission, introduce common standards for collection of evidence, special investigative techniques, protection for whistleblowers, victims and witnesses of corruption and the confiscation of proceeds of corruption with a view to facilitating the detection, investigation, prosecution and adjudication of corruption cases.
They should ensure that appropriate remedies are available for victims of corruption.
The Commission invites Member States to introduce, where appropriate, clear guidelines for staff of public administrations.
Reference might be made to the Commission Decision of 4 April 2002 as a model for such guidelines.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption adds up to approximately 5 % of the world economy.
Organised crime groups use up to 30 % of their proceeds to bribe police, prosecutors, judges and public administration in general to "purchase exemption" from law enforcement measures.
However, comparatively little public money is used to investigate and to prevent corruption cases, although experience shows that higher investment into specialised anti-corruption services could multiply the detection and prosecution of offenders and thereby the effectiveness of any anti-corruption policy.
Specialised anti-corruption authorities and Member States' officials fighting against corruption and related economic crimes such as fraud, money laundering, tax and accounting offences must enjoy appropriate independence, autonomy and protection in the exercise of their functions, be free from improper influence and have effective means for gathering evidence and protecting those persons helping the authorities in combating corruption.
Interagency co-operation and joint investigations, focusing on financial investigations should be enhanced and networks and national contact points specifically dealing with corruption cases should be set-up in order to facilitate international cooperation.
In addition to these suggested initiatives, the Commission has advocated a revision of the EC Treaty to enable the creation of an independent European Public Prosecutor responsible for detecting, prosecuting and remitting for trial the authors of offences against the EC financial interests including corruption of EU public servants.
The establishment of a European public prosecutor would guarantee effective criminal law enforcement while contributing to the respect for individual rights and securing judicial review of the OLAF operational activities  SEE COMMISSION GREEN PAPER ON THE PROTECTION OF COMMUNITY FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A EUROPEAN PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, COM(2001) 715 FROM 12/12/2001 AND ITS FOLLOW-UP REPORT COM(2003) 128 FINAL OF 19/03/2003.
COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE Fighting Corruption in the EU /* COM/2011/0308 final */    COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE  Fighting Corruption in the EU  1.
Introduction  Four out of five EU citizens regard corruption as a serious problem in their Member State.
Despite the fact that the European Union over the last decades has contributed significantly to opening up Europe and making it more transparent, it is evident that a lot remains to be done.
It is not acceptable that an estimated 120 billion Euros per year, or one percent of the EU GDP, is lost to corruption.
This is certainly not a new problem to the EU, and we will not be able to totally eradicate corruption from our societies, but it is telling that the average score of the EU27 in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index has improved only modestly over the last ten years.
Although the nature and extent of corruption vary, it harms all EU Member States and the EU as a whole.
It inflicts financial damage by lowering investment levels, hampering the fair operation of the internal market and reducing public finances.
It causes social harm as organised crime groups use corruption to commit other serious crimes, such as trafficking in drugs and human beings.
Moreover, if not addressed, corruption can undermine trust in democratic institutions and weaken the accountability of political leadership.
Over the last decade, some efforts have been made at international, EU and national level to reduce corruption[5].
At EU level, the anti-corruption legal framework has developed by the adoption of legislation on corruption in the private sector and the accession of the EU to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises that corruption is a serious crime with a cross-border dimension which Member States are not fully equipped to tackle on their own.
Anti-corruption measures have, to some extent, been integrated within a range of EU policies.
However, the implementation of the anti-corruption legal framework remains uneven among EU Member States and unsatisfactory overall.
The EU anti-corruption legislation is not transposed in all Member States.
Some countries have not ratified the most important international anti-corruption instruments.
More importantly, even where anti-corruption institutions and legislation are in place its enforcement is often insufficient in practice.
This reflects a lack of firm political commitment on the part of leaders and decision-makers to combat corruption in all its forms - political corruption, corrupt activities committed by and with organised crime groups, private-to-private corruption and so-called petty corruption.
There is thus an evident need to stimulate political will to fight corruption, and improve the coherence of anti-corruption policies and actions taken by Member States.
That is why the Commission will set up a new mechanism, the EU Anti-Corruption Report, to monitor and assess Member States' efforts against corruption, and consequently encourage more political engagement.
Supported by an expert group and a network of research correspondents, and the necessary EU budget, the Report will be managed by the Commission and published every two years, starting in 2013.
It will give a fair reflection of the achievements, vulnerabilities and commitments of all Member States.
It will identify trends and weaknesses that need to be addressed, as well as stimulate peer learning and exchange of best practices.
Alongside this mechanism, the EU should participate in the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).
The EU should also put stronger focus on corruption in all relevant EU policies – internal as well as external.
The Commission will therefore, in particular, propose modernised EU rules on confiscation of criminal assets in 2011, a strategy to improve criminal financial investigations in Member States in 2012, and adopt in 2011 an Action Plan for how to improve crime statistics.
The Commission will also work with EU agencies such as Europol, Eurojust and CEPOL, as well as with OLAF to step up judicial and police cooperation and improve training of law enforcement officials.
It will continue to prepare modernised EU rules on procurement and on accounting standards and statutory audit for EU companies.
Also, the Commission will adopt a strategy to combat fraud affecting the financial interests of the EU in 2011.
In parallel, the Commission will put a stronger focus on anti-corruption issues within the EU enlargement process and - together with the High Representative - in our neighbourhood policy, as well as make greater use of conditionality in cooperation and development policies.
Business sector initiatives and private-public dialogue at EU level on how to prevent corruption should be further developed.
This Communication presents the objectives of the EU Anti-Corruption Report and how it will operate in practice, and explains how the EU should place greater emphasis on corruption in internal and external policies.
It will be complemented by a Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy.
While the former focuses on the enforcement of anti-corruption policies by the Member States, the latter will mainly cover measures under the responsibility of the Commission for the protection of EU financial interests.2.
Stronger monitoring of anti-corruption efforts 2.1.
Current monitoring and evaluation mechanisms  To date there is no mechanism in place monitoring the existence, and assessing the effectiveness, of anti-corruption policies at EU and Member State level in a coherent cross-cutting manner.
At international level, the main existing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), the OECD Working Group on Bribery, and the review mechanism of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).
Those mechanisms provide an impetus for states parties to implement and enforce anti-corruption standards.
However, they each have several features limiting their potential to address effectively the problems associated with corruption at EU level.
The most inclusive existing instrument relevant for the EU is GRECO, in as much as all Member States are participating.
Through GRECO, the Council of Europe contributes to ensuring minimum standards in a pan-European legal area.
However, given the limited visibility of the intergovernmental GRECO evaluation process and its follow-up mechanism, it has, so far, not generated the necessary political will in the Member States to tackle corruption effectively.
Furthermore, GRECO monitors compliance with a spectrum of anti-corruption standards established by the Council of Europe and accordingly focuses less on specific areas of the EU legislation, such as public procurement.
The GRECO system, moreover, does not allow for comparative analysis and hence the identification of corruption trends in the EU, nor does it actively stimulate the exchange of best practices and peer learning.
The OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transactions (Anti-Bribery Convention) focuses on the specific issue of bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions, and cannot be extended to other areas of importance for the fight against corruption in the EU.
The seventh annual Progress Report prepared by Transparency International indicated that enforcement of the Anti-Bribery Convention has been uneven: active enforcement occurred in only four EU Member States and little or no enforcement in 12 EU Member States.
In spite of a thorough evaluation system in the form of the OECD Working Group on Bribery, political commitment to effective implementation of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention has remained insufficient.
The UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) entered into force in December 2005, and the EU joined in September 2008.
The Conference of States Parties to UNCAC adopted the terms of reference of the Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of UNCAC in November 2009.
The EU supports the involvement of civil society and transparency in the findings of the evaluations under the Mechanism.
However, several features are likely to limit the potential of the UNCAC review mechanism to address problems associated with corruption at EU level: it is an intergovernmental instrument, the cross-review system is likely to leave out policy areas of particular relevance to the EU, it includes states parties which may have lower anti-corruption standards than the EU, the review cycles will be of relatively long duration, and recommendations to states parties which are not implemented might be followed up only a limited number of times.
2.2.
The EU Anti-Corruption Report  Given the limitations of the existing international monitoring and evaluation mechanisms explained above, a specific EU monitoring and assessment mechanism, the EU Anti-Corruption Report, should be established to prompt stronger political will in the Member States and enforcement of the existing legal and institutional tools.
That mechanism should be combined with EU participation in GRECO.
The EU Anti-Corruption Report will be issued by the Commission every two years, starting in 2013.
The establishment of the EU Anti-Corruption Report is the Commission's response to the call from Member States, in the Stockholm Programme, to 'develop indicators, on the basis of existing systems and common criteria, to measure anti-corruption efforts within the Union', and from the European Parliament to monitor anti-corruption efforts in the Member States on a regular basis.
The establishment of the EU Anti-Corruption Report starts from the principle that although there is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to fighting corruption, corruption is a concern for all EU Member States.
Through periodical assessment and publication of objective fact-based reports, the Report will create an additional impetus for Member States to tackle corruption effectively, notably by implementing and enforcing internationally agreed anti-corruption standards.
The mechanism, applicable equally to all Member States, will provide a clearer overview of the existence and effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts in the EU, help identify specific causes of corruption, and thus provide grounds for sound preparation of future EU policy actions.
It will moreover act as a 'crisis alert' to mitigate the potential risks of deeply-rooted problems which could evolve into a crisis.
When preparing the EU Anti-Corruption Report the Commission will cooperate with existing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to avoid additional administrative burdens for Member States and duplication of efforts.
It will draw on the minimum standards against corruption established by existing international instruments such as the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, Civil Law Convention on Corruption, Twenty guiding principles for the fight against corruption, the UNCAC and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.
Given that almost all forms of corruption may have cross-border implications, the Report will not be limited to an exhaustive list of priority areas.
Each EU Anti-Corruption Report will however focus on a number of cross-cutting issues of particular relevance at EU level, as well as selected issues specific to each Member State.
These will be assessed against a number of indicators, based on the already existing standards in the respective fields and some newly developed in the process of preparing the Report.
New indicators will be developed where relevant standards are not yet laid down in an existing instrument or where higher standards are required at EU level.
In the selection of existing and the development of new indicators, the Commission will consult competent anti-corruption authorities in the Member States.
Indicators may include: perceptions of corruption, respondents' behaviour linked to corrupt activities, and criminal justice statistics, including on seizures and confiscations of the proceeds of corruption-related crime.
The EU Anti-Corruption Report will include a quantitative assessment of those indicators and a qualitative analysis of corruption trends and results.
The Anti-Corruption Report will comprise:  A thematic section, highlighting specific aspects of the fight against corruption in the EU based on research and including thematic case studies, examples of best practices and recommendations.
Country analyses, including tailor-made recommendations directed to individual Member States, based on the results of existing monitoring mechanisms and reviews of available evidence from relevant sources.
This section may be accompanied by recommendations for appropriate action at EU level.
Trends at EU level, including the results of a Eurobarometer survey on corruption conducted every two years, measuring perception of corruption in various areas among EU citizens, as well as other relevant sources of information on the experiences with corruption at EU level.
In drawing up the Report, the Commission will rely on a variety of sources of information, including existing monitoring mechanisms (GRECO, OECD, UNCAC), independent experts, research findings, Commission services and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), Member States, EU agencies such as Europol and Eurojust, the European Anti-Corruption Network, Eurobarometer surveys and civil society.
The EU Anti-Corruption Report will be managed by the Commission assisted by:  An expert group advising on: (1) establishing indicators, (2) assessing Member States' performance, (3) identifying best practices, (4) identifying EU trends, (5) making recommendations, and (6) proposing new EU measures where appropriate.
The group will be set up by the Commission, following an open call procedure.
The selected experts may come from a wide range of backgrounds (law enforcement, prevention of corruption, civil society, research etc.
), must enjoy undisputed anti-corruption expertise, a high reputation for integrity and commit to act in their personal professional capacity.
A network of local research correspondents set up by the Commission and consisting of representatives of civil society and academia, who will collect relevant information in each Member State to feed and complement the work of the expert group.
Directly linked to the EU Anti-Corruption Report, the development of an experience sharing programme may be considered to help Member States, local NGOs and other stakeholders to identify shortcomings in anti-corruption policies and best practices, raise awareness or provide training.
The Commission will bear all expenses associated with the EU Anti-Corruption Report, including those of the independent expert group, the network of research correspondents and, if set up, the experience sharing programme.
EU participation in GRECO, although not fully responding to the EU's needs for periodic reporting on anti-corruption efforts across the EU, would create synergies between the two mechanisms.
GRECO could, in particular, provide input to the EU monitoring mechanism in the form of comparative analyses of the existing GRECO evaluation and compliance reports on the EU Member States, and indication of key outstanding recommendations requiring additional follow-up.
In the light of the above, the Commission is setting up an EU anti-corruption reporting mechanism to periodically assess the Member States' efforts in fighting corruption and will request the authorisation of the Council to negotiate EU participation in GRECO with the Council of Europe.
The Commission will consider in the medium and long term, based on the findings of the EU Anti-Corruption Report, the need for additional EU policy initiatives, including the approximation of criminal law in the field of corruption.3.
Better implementation of existing anti-corruption instruments  A number of anti-corruption legal instruments are already in place at EU, European and international level.
This includes the EU Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of the EU Member States which entered into force on 28 September 2005.
With the exception of that Convention, the existing instruments have, however, not yet been ratified and transposed into the law of all EU Member States.
To address corruption effectively, Member States should, as a minimum, take steps to complete the process of ratification and transposition.
3.1.
Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA on combating corruption in the private sector  Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA on combating corruption in the private sector, adopted in July 2003, aims to criminalise both active and passive bribery, establishing more detailed rules on the liability of legal persons and deterrent sanctions.
The first implementation report issued in 2007 showed that many Member States had done little to apply it.
Shortcomings were found in the criminalisation of all elements of active and passive bribery and the provisions on the liability of legal persons.
The second implementation report accompanying this Communication shows that several Member States have still not transposed the most detailed provisions on criminalisation of all elements of active and passive bribery.
Moreover, the liability of legal persons continues to be regulated in an uneven manner at national level.
The Commission urges the Member States to fully transpose all provisions of Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA without delay and to ensure that it is effectively implemented.
Depending on progress, the Commission will consider proposing a Directive replacing the Framework Decision.
In this context, the Commission welcomes the adoption by certain Member States of stricter rules to prevent private sector corruption and reinforced corporate liability for corruption offences.
The Commission intends to support the public-private dialogue and the exchange of best practices in this area.
Private undertakings are encouraged to develop and implement clear common standard rules for their respective fields on accounting, internal audit, codes of conduct and protection of whistleblowers.
3.2.
Other international anti-corruption instruments  Several EU Member States have ratified all or most of the existing international anti-corruption instruments.
However, three EU Member States have not ratified the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, twelve have not ratified its additional Protocol and seven have not ratified the Civil Law Convention on Corruption.
Three Member States have not yet ratified the UNCAC.
Five EU Member States have not ratified the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.
The Commission urges Member States that have not ratified those instruments to do so without delay, taking into account where appropriate the exclusive external competence of the Union, and to fully implement them.
The Commission requests the Member States to notify the Commission without delay of the steps they have taken with a view to ratifying these instruments and any reasons for non-ratification.
In this context, ratification and effective enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention by all EU Member States is of particular importance.
The Commission will analyse possible difficulties encountered by non-OECD EU Member States in the ratification process, as well as deficiencies in implementation and enforcement.
3.3.
Cooperation between the EU and the existing international anti-corruption instruments  The Stockholm Programme calls for increased coordination between Member States in the framework of UNCAC, GRECO and OECD work.
To that end, the Commission will act, in particular, in the following areas.
As regards UNCAC, the Convention contains a legal obligation to carry out self-assessments.
In the case of the EU, that process is complex as it involves cooperation between all EU institutions, as well as with Member States in the matters falling under shared competence.
The Commission has however initiated the process and is analysing the impact of the changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty on the scope of the obligations of the EU within UNCAC.
Once that analysis is completed, the modalities of participation in the review mechanism, including the appointment of experts, will be determined.
The Commission will enhance cooperation with the OECD, possibly through the conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding.
The findings of the OECD's Working Group on Bribery will be used as input for the EU Anti-Corruption Report.
The Commission has analysed the possible modalities for the EU's participation in GRECO and will initiate, within the limits of EU competence, the necessary procedures in this regard[40].
Member States should support the EU's application to participate in GRECO within the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.
The Commission also supports the anti-corruption efforts made within the context of the G-20 and will contribute to the implementation of the G-20 anti-corruption action plan endorsed at the Seoul Summit in November 2010.6.
Conclusion  Corruption continues to be a cause of concern in the EU, as it is globally.
Although the nature and extent of corruption vary, it exists in all Member States, causing serious economic, social, and democratic harm.
International instruments, and EU anti-corruption legislation, are already in place, but implementation remains insufficient.
The Commission calls on EU Member States to ensure that all relevant legal instruments are fully transposed into their legislation and, crucially, effectively followed up and enforced through the detection and prosecution of corruption offences, backed up by criminal law provisions and a systematic track record of deterrent penalties and asset recovery.
To achieve this, firmer political commitment by all decision-makers in the EU is needed.
The existing international monitoring and evaluation mechanisms have, so far, not produced the necessary momentum.
Action at EU level is therefore needed to strengthen the political will, in all EU Member States, to vigorously tackle corruption.
To that end, the Commission will set up the EU Anti-Corruption Report to periodically assess Member States' efforts, starting in 2013.
In parallel, the EU should negotiate its participation in the Council of Europe Group of State against Corruption (GRECO).
The EU should also continue, as part of a comprehensive approach, to address corruption through all relevant EU policies – internal as well as external.
Greater focus should be put on corruption in the areas of judicial and police cooperation, modernised EU rules on confiscation of criminal assets, a revised EU public procurement legislation, better EU crime statistics, an enhanced anti-fraud policy to protect EU financial interests, the EU enlargement process, and greater use of conditionality in EU cooperation and development policies.
At the same time, private-public dialogue at EU level on how to prevent corruption within the business sector should be further developed with the support of the Commission.
These initiatives will not, realistically, eradicate corruption, within or outside the EU.
Taken together, they will however help to reduce the problem, to the benefit of all.
This Communication uses the broad definition of corruption adopted by the Global Programme against Corruption run by the United Nations: 'abuse of power for private gain', which therefore covers corruption in both public and private sectors.
78 %, according to the 2009 Eurobarometer on corruption.
This survey is conducted every two years.
According to research by Transparency International, 5% of the EU citizens pay a bribe annually.
One study suggests that corruption may add as much as 20-25% to the total cost public procurement contracts.
The total economic costs of corruption cannot easily be calculated.
The cited figure is based on estimates by specialised institutions and bodies, such as the International Chamber of Commerce, Transparency International, UN Global Compact, World Economic Forum, Clean Business is Good Business, 2009, which suggest that corruption amounts to 5% of GDP at world level.
From 6.23 in 2000 to 6.30 in 2010, out of the maximum 10.
In the 2010 Index, although nine Member States were ranked amongst the 20 least corrupt countries in the world, eight Member States were ranked below 5.
The main findings and tendencies of the Index for the EU have been confirmed by the World Bank's worldwide governance indicators, i.e.
a clear differences among individual Member States, with nine EU Member States ranked as best anti-corruption performers and ten as worst performers.
Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union lists corruption among those crimes for which directives providing minimum rules on definition of criminal offences and sanctions may be established, since corruption often has implications across, and beyond, internal EU borders.
Bribery across borders, but also other forms of corruption, such as corruption in the judiciary, may affect competition and investment flows.
The Commission does not have the power to bring legal proceedings against Member States for failure to transpose measures adopted under the Third Pillar of the Treaty, prior to the entry into force of the TFEU.
Such proceedings will be possible from 1 December 2014, pursuant to Article 10 of Protocol No 36 on Transitional Provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
A specific monitoring mechanism applicable to two Member States, the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) for Romania and Bulgaria, has existed since 2006 (Commission Decisions 2006/928/EC and 2006/929/EC of 13 December 2006 (OJ L 354, 14.12.2006, pp.
56, 58).
The CVM surfaced as an ad-hoc solution for the outstanding shortcomings found on the eve of EU accession.
In this context, the Commission carries out verifications against a number of pre-defined benchmarks in the area of justice reforms and anti-corruption, as well as, in the case of Bulgaria, the fight against organised crime.

Stronger focus on corruption in EU internal policies  In addition to stronger monitoring and implementation of existing legal instruments, anti-corruption considerations should, as part of a comprehensive approach, be integrated into all relevant EU policies – internal as well as external.
A stronger focus should be put on corruption, in particular, in the following policy areas.
4.1.
Law enforcement, judicial and police cooperation within the EU  Member States should take all necessary steps to ensure the effective detection, prosecution and a stable track record of dissuasive penalties and recovery of criminally acquired assets in corruption cases.
In this context, judicial and police cooperation between EU Member States, financial investigations, training of law enforcement personnel, and the protection of whistleblowers is of particular importance.
4.1.1.
Judicial and police cooperation  Under its 2010-2014 strategy, Europol is committed to providing increased support for law enforcement operations and function as the EU criminal information hub and EU centre for law enforcement expertise.
The Commission urges Europol to step up its efforts to combat corruption as a facilitator for organised crime activity.
This should include the production of regular threat assessments.
Since 2004, Eurojust has been involved in a slightly increasing number of corruption cases.
Although in 2010 these cases represented only 2% of its total workload, the growing number of Member States involved attests to an increasing need for judicial cooperation in corruption cases with a cross-border dimension.
The Commission urges Eurojust to strengthen its efforts to facilitate the exchange of information among Member States' authorities on corruption cases with cross-border implications.
Finally, since 2008 the EU contact-point network against corruption (EACN) has brought together Member States' anti-corruption authorities, as well as the Commission, OLAF, Europol and Eurojust.
The EACN is managed by the Austrian-led network European Partners against Corruption (EPAC).
The Commission will work with the EACN towards more concrete deliverables, stronger focus on operational issues of relevance for corruption investigators, and a clearer delimitation of the respective roles of EPAC and the EACN.
The Commission considers preparing a proposal to modify the Council Decision establishing the EACN.
4.1.2.
Financial investigations and asset recovery  Four implementation reports issued by the Commission have pointed to delays in the efforts by many Member States to adopt measures regarding confiscation of the proceeds of crime.
In 2011 the Commission will propose a revised EU legal framework on confiscation and asset recovery to ensure that courts in Member States are able to effectively confiscate criminal and criminally tainted assets and to fully recover the corresponding values, including in cases involving corruption.
The third Anti-Money Laundering Directive lists corruption as one of the predicate offences for money laundering.
Evaluations conducted by the OECD's Working Group on Bribery suggest that very few foreign bribery cases are detected through the national anti-money laundering systems.
The Commission stresses the need for further cooperation between the Financial Intelligence Units, specialized anti-corruption agencies and law enforcement bodies in Member States.
Member States should ensure that financial investigations are pursued effectively and consistently in corruption cases and that any potential link with organized crime and money laundering is always considered.
The Commission will adopt a strategy in 2012 to strengthen the quality of financial investigations in Member States and the development of financial intelligence to be shared between authorities within Member States, as well as between Member States and EU agencies and at international level.
4.1.3.
Protection of whistleblowers  Effective protection of whistleblowers against retaliation is a key element of anti-corruption policies.
The relevant legal framework in the EU is uneven, creating difficulties in handling cases with a cross-border dimension.
The Commission will carry out an assessment of the protection of persons reporting financial crimes that will also cover protection of whistleblowers, and related data protection issues, as a basis for further action at EU level.
4.1.4.
Training of law enforcement officials  The Commission will support the development of targeted training programmes on corruption for law enforcement agencies through the European Police College (CEPOL).
Those programmes should cover specific aspects of handling corruption cases with cross-border implications, for example, the gathering and exchanging of evidence, the link with financial investigations, and the link with investigations of organised crime offences.
4.2.
Public procurement  Public expenditure on works, goods and services accounts for roughly 19% of EU GDP (2009).
Almost a fifth of this expenditure falls within the scope of the EU Directives on public procurement (i.e.
approx.
€420 billion, or 3.6% of EU GDP).
The current EU legal framework on public procurementdoes not include specific provisions on prevention and sanctioning of conflicts of interest, and comprises only few specific rules on sanctioning favouritism and corruption.
In January 2011, the Commission launched a consultation on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy.
It raises the question whether a common definition of conflict of interest and possible safeguards against such situations are needed at EU level, including the publication of concluded contracts to enhance transparency, the extension of exclusion grounds and 'self-cleaning' measures.
In the preparation of a modernised EU public procurement legislation, the Commission will carefully consider these issues.
In this context, the Commission will also consider proposing legislation on concessions to create better conditions for the fair and competitive award of these contracts, thus reducing the risks of corruption.
4.3.
Cohesion policy to support administrative capacity building  The EU's cohesion policy supports the strengthening of institutional capacity in Member States to make public services and administrations more efficient.
Administrative capacity and good governance are included as main priorities in the 2007-2013 Community Strategic Guidelines for cohesion.
A total of 3.5 billion Euros have been allocated under those guidelines to strengthen institutional capacity at national, regional and local level of which 2 billion Euros stem from the European Social Fund.
The 2007-2013 European Social Fund regulation introduced a specific priority for strengthening administrative capacity in less developed regions and Member States.
Such support for institutional capacity will have a positive impact on preventing corruption, by making public services and administrations more efficient and transparent.
Some Member States have included measures to fight corrcuption in their operation programmes.
The Commission intends to continue support for the strengthening of institutional capacity and make it available to all Member States and regions.
4.4.
Accounting standards and statutory audit for EU companies  The use of International Financial Reporting Standards for consolidated financial statements of companies listed on the EU's stock markets became mandatory in 2005.
The procedures on statutory audit were harmonised, introducing a requirement for external quality assurance, provisions on public supervision, duties and independence of statutory auditors and the application of international standards.
These measures increased the credibility, quality and transparency of financial reporting, reducing the risks of corruption.
The Commission conducted public consultations in 2010 on the audit policy lessons from the financial crisis.
The results of the consultation will assist the Commission in deciding on future measures aimed at ensuring consolidated checks and control systems within EU companies to reduce the risk of corrupt practices.
These may cover matters such as: clarifications of the role of auditors, governance and the independence of audit firms, supervision of auditors, creation of a single market for the provision of audit services, and the simplification of rules for SMEs.
4.5.
Preventing and fighting political corruption  As political scandals have repeatedly shown, complex connections are sometimes developed between political actors, private undertakings, media, trade associations and foundations.
These connections are driven by mutual benefits in influencing key political and economic decisions, putting democratic institutions and procedures at risk and rendering the detection of corrupt practices more difficult.
Under the impetus of the GRECO monitoring process, some progress has been seen in the legal and institutional setting for the financing of political parties in several Member States.
Unfortunately, the enforcement of transparency and supervision rules is still unsatisfactory in some Member States.
The Commission calls upon the Member States, the national Parliaments and the European Parliament to ensure more transparency and allow effective supervision of the financing of political parties and other interest groups.
The Commission is also committed to respecting its obligations to defend the general interest of the Union, in conformity with the obligations laid down by the Treaties, in its own Code of conduct and in other relevant rules.
The media have a key role in increasing transparency and accountability of political figures and are often a resourceful tool for fighting political corruption.
The Commission urges Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure effective implementation of the existing legal framework guaranteeing the independence and freedom of the media, including on media funding.
The Commission will support, through its existing programmes, training of media to strengthen knowledge in specific areas relevant for the detection of corruption (e.g.
money laundering, political party financing, banking, stock exchange markets).
The Commission also supports in other ways action limiting political corruption, including through funding of civil society initiatives.
4.6.
Improving statistics  Currently there is no uniform statistical system across the EU to measure the nature and extent of corruption or the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures.
As a follow-up to the EU Action Plan to develop a comprehensive and coherent EU strategy to measure crime and criminal justice[54], a new Action Plan (2011-2015) is under preparation.
The Commission will set up a sub-group of experts in statistics, as a first step in work aimed at establishing a uniform EU statistics system on corruption.
4.7.
Integrity in sport  Corruption in sport is an increasingly visible problem with cross-border dimensions, mainly related to opacity of transfers and match-fixing.
The Commission will analyse possible solutions to addres match-fixing more effectively by first launching a study on how corruption in sport is being covered in national legislation.
This may offer grounds for further policy actions in this area, such as possibly establishing minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in this field.
4.8.
Protecting EU public money against corruption  More than a decade ago, corruption charges led to the entire resignation of the Commission and the setting up of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
One of the core tasks of OLAF is to conduct administrative investigations for the purpose of fighting fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the EU.
In 2011, several initiatives will be taken to step up the fight against fraud and corruption affecting EU public money.
The Communication on the protection of EU financial interests by criminal law and administrative investigations sets out how the Commission intends to safeguard taxpayers' money at EU level against illegal activities, including against threats posed by corruption inside and outside the EU institutions.
The Communication points to opportunities for the improvement of the criminal law framework, of procedural tools for investigators and prosecutors, as well as possible institutional developments such as the setting up of a European Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Commission also intends to adopt a new anti-fraud strategy reinforcing the Union's financial policies with a view to better protect the EU's financial interests.
The strategy will identify priorities and specific areas of activity in order to enhance the current Commission anti-fraud framework, with a focus on prevention.
Complementing those initiatives, the Commission's proposal for amending the legal framework of OLAF aims at increasing the efficiency and speed of OLAF investigations, at strengthening procedural guarantees, as well as at reinforcing OLAF's cooperation with Member States and at improving its governance.
5.
Stronger focus on corruption in EU external policies 5.1.
Candidate countries, potential candidates and neighbourhood countries  The process of enlargement of the EU has been a key vehicle for major anti-corruption reforms in the candidate countries and potential candidates.
The most recent accessions had a considerable impact on the actual weight of anti-corruption policies within the EU.
They also showed that at the time of accession it was still very difficult to demonstrate a track record of implementation and the irreversibility of anti-corruption reforms.
Moreover, following accession, efforts to fight corruption still had to be monitored.
The 2005 negotiating frameworks for Croatia and Turkey introduced a specific chapter covering a range of rule of law issues, including judicial reform and the fight against corruption.
The renewed consensus on enlargement, has further strengthened the focus on the rule of law.
Aware of the fact that, without a strong political will, investing EU funds in institution building alone cannot guarantee the success of anti-corruption policies, the Commission intensified in 2010 its dialogue on rule of law with the candidate countries and potential candidates.
The reinforced dialogue builds on the experience gained during the visa liberalisation process.
The roadmaps containing benchmarks to which countries had to conform in order to obtain visa liberalisation proved to be an efficient tool to motivate and prioritise reform.
The aim of the dialogue on rule of law is to strengthen such benchmarking at earlier stages of the pre-accession process.
The Commission Opinions on Albania's and Montenegro's applications for EU membership already set recommendations that should be met before the opening of negotiations.
The dialogue will be accompanied by yearly expert missions to be carried out with participation of experts from EU Member States, which will in this way be associated to the process more closely.
Based on these tools, the Commission will continue to give high priority to the monitoring of anti-corruption policies and will enforce thorough scrutiny from the early stages of accession preparations with the aim of securing guarantees for the sustainability of reforms.
The Commission will also promote close coordination of the international donors to avoid any overlapping and to better channel the resources invested.
Under the umbrella of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the High Representative and the Commission will promote reinforcing the capacity to fight corruption in the neighbourhood countries as a key aspect of the support given.
This is especially important given the recent events in North Africa, where uprisings against the regimes were also prompted by the urge to eradicate a culture of corruption in their countries.
5.2.
Cooperation and development policies  The support for strengthening good governance and democratisation granted by the EU as part of cooperation and development policy also covers anti-corruption policies.
The Commission follows in this context a partnership-based approach, engaging dialogue with partner countries' governments and civil society, EU Member States and other donors.
While recognising that without political will inside the country, outside support is unlikely to deliver results, the Commission considers that incentive-based approaches may prove their benefits.
The Commission intends to strengthen dialogue with partner countries on anti-fraud and anti-corruption issues and its support to capacity building, leading towards the adoption of national strategies to fight corruption in all its forms.
During the programming period as well as throughout the implementation process particular attention will be paid to such strategies and their effective implementation.
In line with that objective, the Commission will promote greater use of the conditionality principle in the field of development to encourage compliance with minimum international anti-corruption standards as set out in UNCAC and other international and regional conventions these countries are party to.
In the same vein, the Commission will promote a stronger use of the provisions covering anti-corruption matters already existing in the legal bases for cooperation with partner countries, undertaking specific consultations in response to instances of serious corruption cases, and applying sanctions if appropriate measures are not put in place.
Finally, the Commission has established, and will continue to support, global frameworks aiming at setting transparent systems for extracting and trading natural resources and raw materials, such as the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
5.3.
Trade policy  EU trade policy contributes to encouraging third countries to respect, inter alia, human rights and good governance through bilateral trade relations and through tools such as the Generalised System of Preferences.
The Commission recently proposed a reshape of the Generalized System of Preferences, reinforcing the incentives for the respect of good governance standards through the adherence and implementation of key international conventions such as the UNCAC.
The Commission will continue to promote the inclusion of specific provisions in Free Trade Agreements on transparency in international government procurement, and in the content of World Trade Organization the extension to other WTO Parties of the Agreement on Government Procurement which contains provisions on enhanced transparency in international procurement, limiting the risk of corruption.
DECISION (EU) 2016/456 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK  of 4 March 2016  concerning the terms and conditions for European Anti-Fraud Office investigations of the European Central Bank, in relation to the prevention of fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union (ECB/2016/3)  (recast)  THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular Article 12.3 thereof, Having regard to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and the Council and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (1), and in particular Article 4(1) and (7) thereof, Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 provides that the European Anti-Fraud Office (hereinafter the 'Office') is to initiate and conduct administrative fraud investigations (hereinafter 'internal investigations') within the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies established by, or on the basis of, the Treaties for the purpose of fighting fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union.
To that end, it investigates serious matters relating to the discharge of professional duties constituting a dereliction of the obligations of officials and other servants of the Union liable to result in disciplinary or, as the case may be, criminal proceedings, or an equivalent failure to discharge obligations on the part of members of institutions and bodies, heads of offices and agencies or staff members of institutions, bodies, offices or agencies not subject to the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the Union (hereinafter the 'Staff Regulations').
(2) For the European Central Bank (ECB) such professional duties and obligations, in particular the obligations relating to professional conduct and professional secrecy, are laid down in (a) the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank, (b) the European Central Bank Staff Rules, (c) Annex IIb to the Conditions of Employment concerning the Conditions of Short-Term Employment, and (d) the European Central Bank Rules for Short-Term Employment, and further guidance is given in (e) the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing Council (2), (f) the Supplementary Code of Ethics Criteria for the members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (3), and (g) the Code of Conduct for the members of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank (4) (together referred to hereinafter as the 'ECB conditions of employment').
(3) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 provides that in relation to protecting the Union's financial interests and fighting fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, the Office 'shall carry out administrative investigations within the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies' in accordance with the conditions set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and in the decisions adopted by each institution, body, office or agency.
Article 4(7) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 provides that each institution, body, office and agency is to adopt a decision which 'shall include, in particular, a rule concerning a duty on the part of officials, other servants, members of institutions or bodies, heads of offices or agencies, or staff members to cooperate with and supply information to the Office, while ensuring the confidentiality of the internal investigation'.
In accordance with Union case-law, the Office may open an investigation only on the basis of sufficiently serious suspicions (5).
(4) Pursuant to Recital 12 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, investigations should be conducted in accordance with the Treaties, in particular Protocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of the European Union, and should also respect the Staff Regulations, human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the principle of fairness, the right of persons involved to express their views on the facts concerning them and the principle that the conclusions of an investigation may be based solely on elements which have evidential value, as well as general principles common to the Member States and recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union, such as, for instance, the confidentiality of legal advice (legal privilege).
To that end, the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should lay down the terms and conditions under which internal investigations are to be conducted.
(5) Decision ECB/2004/11 (6) was adopted to lay down the terms and conditions under which internal investigations under Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) were to be conducted in the ECB.
In order to take into account that Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and that new ECB bodies have been established since the adoption of Decision ECB/2004/11, there is a need to revise the current legal framework.
(6) Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (8) established the Supervisory Board as an ECB internal body to plan and execute the specific tasks concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions conferred upon the ECB.
On the basis of Article 24(1) and Article 25(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, the ECB established an Administrative Board of Review (9) and a Mediation Panel (10).
Furthermore, on the basis of Articles 3(1) and 143(1) of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2014/17) (11), the ECB established joint supervisory teams for the supervision of each significant supervised entity or significant supervised group and on-site inspection teams.
Subsequently, on the basis of Articles 9a and 9b of the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank (12) respectively, the ECB established an Ethics Committee (13) and an Audit Committee.
(7) This Decision should apply to the members of joint supervisory teams and on-site inspection teams who are not subject to the ECB conditions of employment.
Members of staff of national competent authorities who are members of joint supervisory teams and on-site inspection teams fall within the ECB's sphere of control in matters related to their work on tasks conferred upon the ECB under Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.
Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 provides that the ECB is responsible for the effective and consistent functioning of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
Articles 6(1) and 146(1) of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17) provide that the members of joint supervisory teams and on-site inspection teams are subject to the instructions of the respective team coordinator.
These provisions are based on Article 6(7) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, which requires the ECB to adopt a framework to organise the practical arrangements for the implementation of the cooperation within the SSM.
(8) In adopting this Decision, it is incumbent on the ECB to justify any restrictions on internal investigations affecting the specific tasks and duties entrusted to the ECB by Articles 127 and 128 of the Treaty and by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.
Such restrictions should ensure the confidentiality necessary for certain ECB information and give effect to the legislator's intention of reinforcing the fight against fraud.
Other than for these specific tasks and duties, the ECB should be treated, also for the purposes of this Decision, as a public entity similar to other Union institutions and bodies.
(9) In exceptional cases, the circulation outside the ECB of some of the confidential information it holds in order to perform its tasks could seriously undermine the ECB's functioning.
In such cases, the decision on granting the Office access to information or transmitting information to it should be taken by the Executive Board.
Access should be granted to information that is more than one year old in areas such as monetary policy decisions, or operations related to the management of foreign reserves and interventions on foreign exchange markets.
Restrictions in other areas, such as in relation to information concerning the tasks conferred upon the ECB by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, data received by the ECB from national competent authorities regarding the stability of the financial system or individual credit institutions, and information regarding the security features and technical specifications of current and future euro banknotes, should not be limited to specific periods of time.
Although this Decision should limit to certain specific areas of activity the scope of information whose circulation outside the ECB could seriously undermine the ECB's functioning, it is necessary to provide for the possibility of adapting the Decision to cover unforeseen developments to ensure that the ECB continues to fulfil the tasks assigned to it by the Treaty.
(10) This Decision should take into account that the members of the ECB's Governing Council and General Council who are not also members of the ECB's Executive Board exercise national functions in addition to their functions within the European System of Central Banks, and that the members of the ECB's Supervisory Board, Mediation Panel, joint supervisory teams and on-site inspection teams who are representatives of the national competent authorities of the participating Member States also exercise national functions in addition to their tasks under Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.
Exercising such national functions is a matter for national law, which falls outside the scope of the internal investigations of the Office.
This Decision should therefore only apply to the professional activities of such persons undertaken in their capacity as members of the ECB's Governing Council, General Council, Supervisory Board, Mediation Panel, joint supervisory teams and on-site inspection teams.
(11) This Decision should also take into account that the external members of the ECB's Administrative Board of Review, Audit Committee and Ethics Committee may exercise other functions in addition to their mandates.
Exercising such functions falls outside the scope of the internal investigations of the Office.
This Decision should therefore only apply to the professional activities of such persons undertaken in their capacity as members of the ECB's Administrative Board of Review, Audit Committee and Ethics Committee.
(12) Article 37.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the 'Statute of the ESCB') provides that members of the governing bodies and the staff of the ECB are required, even after their duties have ceased, not to disclose information of the kind covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.
Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 provides that members of the Supervisory Board, staff of the ECB and staff seconded by participating Member States carrying out supervisory duties, even after their duties have ceased, are subject to the same professional secrecy requirements.
Article 22(1) of Decision ECB/2014/16 and Article 2(4) of Decision (EU) 2015/433 (ECB/2014/59) respectively provide the same for members of the ECB's Administrative Board of Review and their alternates and for members of the ECB's Ethics Committee.
Paragraph 6 of the Audit Committee mandate (14) provides that the members of the Audit Committee shall not divulge any information of a confidential nature coming to their knowledge during the performance of their duties to persons or bodies outside the ECB/Eurosystem.
Under Article 10 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, the Office and its employees are subject to the same conditions of confidentiality and professional secrecy as those applying to ECB staff under the Statute of the ESCB and the ECB conditions of employment.
(13) Under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, the national competent authorities, in conformity with national rules, give the necessary assistance to enable the staff of the Office to fulfil their tasks effectively.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the ECB are signatories to a Headquarters Agreement dated 18 September 1998 (15), which implements Protocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of the European Union in respect of the ECB and contains provisions regarding the inviolability of the ECB's premises, archives, and communications, and on the diplomatic privileges and immunities of the members of the ECB's Executive Board.
(14) Given the replacement of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and the substantial number of amendments necessary, Decision ECB/2004/11 should be repealed and replaced by this Decision,  HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1  Scope of application  This Decision applies to: members of the ECB's Governing and General Councils, in matters related to their function as members of these ECB decision-making bodies, members of the ECB's Executive Board, members of the ECB's Supervisory Board, in matters related to their function as members of that body, members of the ECB's Administrative Board of Review, in matters related to their function as members of that body, members of the ECB's Mediation Panel, in matters related to their function as members of that body, members of the ECB's Audit Committee, in matters related to their function as members of that body, members of the ECB's Ethics Committee, in matters related to their function as members of that body, members of the governing bodies or any member of staff of the national central banks or national competent authorities, who participate in the meetings of the ECB's Governing and General Councils and Supervisory Board as alternates and/or accompanying persons in matters related to that function (hereinafter jointly referred to as 'participants in the decision-making and other bodies'), and permanent or temporary ECB members of staff, who are subject to the ECB conditions of employment, persons working for the ECB other than on the basis of an employment contract, including members of staff of national competent authorities who are members of joint supervisory teams and on-site inspection teams, in matters related to their work for the ECB (hereinafter jointly referred to as 'relevant persons').
Article 2  Duty to cooperate with the Office  Without prejudice to the relevant provisions of the Treaties, Protocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of the European Union, the Statute of the ESCB and the Staff Regulations, with full respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the general principles common to the Member States and subject to the procedures laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and to the rules laid down in this Decision, participants in the decision-making and other bodies and relevant persons shall cooperate with and supply information to the Office, while ensuring the confidentiality of an internal investigation.
Article 3  Duty to report any information about illegal activity  1.
Relevant persons who become aware of information which gives rise to a suspicion of the existence of possible cases of fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the Union's financial interests shall without delay provide either the Director Internal Audit, the senior manager in charge of their business area, or the member of the Executive Board who is primarily responsible for their business area with such information.
The latter persons shall without delay transmit the information to the Director-General Secretariat.
Relevant persons must in no way suffer inequitable or discriminatory treatment as a result of having communicated the information referred to in this Article.
2.
Participants in the decision-making and other bodies who become aware of information as referred to in paragraph 1 shall inform the Director-General Secretariat or the President.
3.
When the Director-General Secretariat or, where appropriate, the President receives information in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2, they shall, subject to Article 4 of this Decision, transmit it without delay to the Office and inform the Directorate Internal Audit and, where appropriate, the President.
4.
In cases in which a participant in the decision-making and other bodies or a relevant person has concrete information supporting the possible existence of a case of fraud or corruption or any other illegal activity within the meaning of paragraph 1, and, at the same time, has justified reasons to consider that the procedure provided for in the above paragraphs would prevent in that specific case the proper reporting of such information to the Office, they may report directly to the Office without being subject to Article 4.
Article 4  Cooperation with the Office with regard to sensitive information  1.
In exceptional cases, in which the circulation of certain information outside the ECB could seriously undermine the ECB's functioning, the decision on whether to grant the Office access to such information or to transmit such information to it shall be taken by the Executive Board.
This shall apply to: information concerning monetary policy decisions, or operations related to the management of foreign reserves and interventions on foreign exchange markets, provided that such information is less than one year old; information concerning the tasks conferred upon the ECB by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013; data received by the ECB from the national competent authorities regarding the stability of the financial system or individual credit institutions; and information concerning the euro banknotes' security features and technical specifications.
2.
Any such decision of the Executive Board shall take all relevant factors into account, such as the degree of sensitivity of the information required by the Office for the investigation, its importance for the investigation and the seriousness of the suspicion as presented by the Office, by the participant in the decision-making and other bodies or the relevant person to the President, and the degree of risk for the ECB's future functioning.
If access is not granted, the decision shall state the reasons for this.
With regard to data that the ECB receives on the stability of the financial system or individual credit institutions, the Executive Board may decide not to grant the Office access if it or the relevant national competent authority considers that disclosing the information concerned would place the stability of the financial system or the individual credit institution at risk.
3.
In very exceptional cases that concern information related to a particular area of ECB activity, of equivalent sensitivity to the categories of information referred to in paragraph 1, the Executive Board may provisionally decide not to grant the Office access to such information.
Paragraph 2 shall apply to such decisions, which shall be valid for a maximum of six months.
Thereafter, the Office shall be granted access to the information concerned, unless the Governing Council has in the meantime amended the present Decision by adding the category of information concerned to the categories covered by paragraph 1.
Article 5  Assistance from the ECB in internal investigations  1.
When initiating an internal investigation of the ECB, the Office's agents shall be granted access to the ECB's premises by the manager in charge of ECB security upon production of a written authorisation issued by the Director-General of the Office, which indicates the following:  (a) the agents' identity and job title in the Office;  (b) the subject matter and purpose of the investigation;  (c) the legal bases for conducting the investigation and the investigative powers arising from those bases.
The President, the Vice-President and the Director Internal Audit shall be informed immediately.
2.
The Directorate Internal Audit shall assist the Office in the practical organisation of investigations.
3.
Participants in the decision-making and other bodies and relevant persons shall supply any requested information to the Office's agents who are conducting an investigation, unless the requested information could be sensitive within the meaning of Article 4, in which case the Executive Board shall decide whether or not the information should be provided.
The Directorate Internal Audit shall record all information supplied.
Article 6  Informing interested parties  1.
Where the possible implication of a participant in the decision-making and other bodies or a relevant person in fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity within the meaning of Article 3(1) emerges, the interested party shall be informed rapidly provided that this will not be harmful to the investigation (16).
In any event, conclusions referring by name to a participant in the decision-making or other bodies or a relevant person may not be drawn without the interested party being given the opportunity to express their views on all the facts relating to them, including any evidence existing against them.
Interested parties have the right to remain silent, to refrain from incriminating themselves and to seek personal legal assistance.
2.
In cases necessitating the maintenance of absolute secrecy for the purpose of the investigation and/or requiring the use of investigative procedures falling within the remit of a national judicial authority, compliance with the obligation to invite a participant in the decision-making or other bodies or a relevant person to express their views may be deferred for a limited period in agreement with the President or Vice-President.
Article 7  Information on the closing of an investigation with no further action taken  If, following an internal investigation, no case can be made against a participant in the decision-making and other bodies or a relevant person against whom allegations have been made, the internal investigation shall be closed, with no further action taken, by decision of the Director-General of the Office, who shall inform the participant in the decision-making and other bodies or relevant person thereof in writing.
Article 8  Waiver of immunity  Any request from a national police or judicial authority for waiver of applicable immunity from judicial proceedings of a participant in the decision-making and other bodies or a relevant person in possible cases of fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union shall be transmitted to the Director-General of the Office for his opinion.
The Governing Council shall decide on any relevant waiver as far as participants in the decision-making and other bodies are concerned, and the Executive Board shall decide on any relevant waiver as far as relevant persons are concerned.
Article 9  Entry into force and repeal  1.
This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
2.
Decision ECB/2004/11 is repealed with effect from the twentieth day following the publication of this Decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector   Official Journal L 192 , 31/07/2003 P. 0054 - 0056  Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector  THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 29, Article 31(1)(e) and Article 34(2)(b) thereof, Having regard to the initiative of the Kingdom of Denmark, Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament, Whereas:  (1) Along with globalisation, recent years have brought an increase in cross-border trade in goods and services.
Any corruption in the private sector within a Member State is thus not just a domestic problem but also a transnational problem, most effectively tackled by means of a European Union joint action.
(2) On 27 September 1996 the Council adopted the Act drawing up a Protocol to the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests.
The Protocol, which entered into force on 17 October 2002, contains definitions of and harmonised penalties for offences of corruption.
(3) On 26 May 1997 the Council approved a Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union.
(4) On 22 December 1998, the Council also adopted Joint Action 98/742/JHA on corruption in the private sector.
In connection with the adoption of that Joint Action, the Council issued a statement to the effect that it agreed that the Joint Action represents the first step at European Union level towards combating such corruption, and that additional measures will be implemented at a later stage in the light of the outcome of the assessment which is to take place pursuant to Article 8(2) of the Joint Action.
A report on Member States' transposition of that Joint Action into national law is not yet available.
(5) On 13 June 2002 the Council adopted Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States, in which corruption is included in the list of offences falling within the scope of the European arrest warrant, in respect of which prior verification of double criminality is not required.
(6) Under Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union, it is the Union's objective to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice, an objective to be achieved by preventing and combating crime, organised or otherwise, including corruption.
(7) According to point 48 of the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999, corruption is an area of particular relevance in establishing minimum rules on what constitutes a criminal offence in Member States and the penalties applicable.
(8) An OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions was approved at a negotiating conference on 21 November 1997, and the Council of Europe has also approved a Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, which opened for signature on 27 January 1999.
That Convention is accompanied by an Agreement establishing the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).
Negotiations have also been opened for a UN Convention on combating corruption.
(9) Member States attach particular importance to combating corruption in both the public and the private sector, in the belief that in both those sectors it poses a threat to a law-abiding society as well as distorting competition in relation to the purchase of goods or commercial services and impeding sound economic development.
In that context the Member States which have not yet ratified the European Union Convention of 26 May 1997 and the Council of Europe Convention of 27 January 1999 will consider how to do so as soon as possible.
(10) The aim of this Framework Decision is in particular to ensure that both active and passive corruption in the private sector are criminal offences in all Member States, that legal persons may also be held responsible for such offences, and that these offences incur effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties,  HAS ADOPTED THIS FRAMEWORK DECISION:  Article 1  Definitions  For the purposes of this Framework Decision:  "legal person" means any entity having such status under the applicable national law, except for States or other public bodies acting in the exercise of State authority and for public international organisations,  "breach of duty" shall be understood in accordance with national law.
The concept of breach of duty in national law should cover as a minimum any disloyal behaviour constituting a breach of a statutory duty, or, as the case may be, a breach of professional regulations or instructions, which apply within the business of a person who in any capacity directs or works for a private sector entity.
Article 2  Active and passive corruption in the private sector  1.
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the following intentional conduct constitutes a criminal offence, when it is carried out in the course of business activities:  (a) promising, offering or giving, directly or through an intermediary, to a person who in any capacity directs or works for a private-sector entity an undue advantage of any kind, for that person or for a third party, in order that that person should perform or refrain from performing any act, in breach of that person's duties;  (b) directly or through an intermediary, requesting or receiving an undue advantage of any kind, or accepting the promise of such an advantage, for oneself or for a third party, while in any capacity directing or working for a private-sector entity, in order to perform or refrain from performing any act, in breach of one's duties.
2.
Paragraph 1 applies to business activities within profit and non-profit entities.
3.
A Member State may declare that it will limit the scope of paragraph 1 to such conduct which involves, or could involve, a distortion of competition in relation to the purchase of goods or commercial services.
4.
Declarations referred to in paragraph 3 shall be communicated to the Council at the time of the adoption of this Framework Decision and shall be valid for five years as from 22 July 2005.
5.
The Council shall review this Article in due time before 22 July 2010 with a view to considering whether it shall be possible to renew declarations made under paragraph 3.
Article 3  Instigation, aiding and abetting  Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that instigating, aiding and abetting the conduct referred to in Article 2 constitute criminal offences.
Article 4  Penalties and other sanctions  1.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the conduct referred to in Articles 2 and 3 is punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties.
2.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the conduct referred to in Article 2 is punishable by a penalty of a maximum of at least one to three years of imprisonment.
3.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures in accordance with its constitutional rules and principles to ensure that where a natural person in relation to a certain business activity has been convicted of the conduct referred to in Article 2, that person may, where appropriate, at least in cases where he or she had a leading position in a company within the business concerned, be temporarily prohibited from carrying on this particular or comparable business activity in a similar position or capacity, if the facts established give reason to believe there to be a clear risk of abuse of position or of office by active or passive corruption.
Article 5  Liability of legal persons  1.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable for offences referred to in Articles 2 and 3 committed for their benefit by any person, acting either individually or as part of an organ of the legal person, who has a leading position within the legal person, based on:  (a) a power of representation of the legal person;  (b) an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person; or  (c) an authority to exercise control within the legal person.
2.
Apart from the cases provided for in paragraph 1, each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that a legal person can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in paragraph 1 has made possible the commission of an offence of the type referred to in Articles 2 and 3 for the benefit of that legal person by a person under its authority.
3.

DIJSSELBLOEM Explanatory Report on the Second Protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests (Text approved by the Council on 12 March 1999)   Official Journal C 091 , 31/03/1999 P. 0008 - 0019    EXPLANATORY REPORT on the Second Protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests (Text approved by the Council on 12 March 1999) (1999/C 91/02)  I.
INTRODUCTION  The Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests was drawn up by the Council and signed by the representatives of the Governments of the Member States on 26 July 1995.
This Convention (hereinafter referred to as the 'Convention' or 'Fraud Convention') constitutes the first agreement under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) dealing with fraud affecting the European Communities' budget.
A First Protocol to the Convention was drawn up and signed on 27 September 1996.
It is primarily aimed at acts of corruption which involve national and Community officials and damage, or are likely to damage, the European Communities' financial interests and will be referred to as the 'First' or 'Corruption Protocol'.
The Protocol on the interpretation, by way of preliminary rulings, by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, of the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests was drawn up and signed on 29 November 1996.
This instrument allows Member States to accept, by a declaration made at the time of the signing of the Protocol or any time thereafter, the jurisdiction of the Court to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of the Convention and the First Protocol.
Alongside the drawing up of the above instruments on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, two instruments of particular interest in this context have been adopted by the European Community.
These are Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities.
In the act of the Council drawing up the Convention, the Council stressed that the Convention should be supplemented shortly afterwards by another legal instrument, in such a way as to improve the effectiveness of protection under criminal law of the European Communities' financial interests.
The Commission presented a draft for a Second Protocol to the Fraud Convention in early 1996.
It referred to the intention expressed by the Council when drawing up the Convention, as well as to the Council resolution of 6 December 1994 on the legal protection of the financial interests of the Communities.
In the resolution, the Council requested the elaboration of possibilities to impose sanctions on legal persons, as well as the extension of legislation concerning money laundering to the protection of the European Communities' financial interests.
The Commission initiative and draft were taken over by the Italian Presidency of the Council and, by the end of that Presidency, the discussions on the draft were well advanced.
In June 1996, the Italian Presidency consulted the European Parliament pursuant to Article K.6 of the Treaty on European Union and the Parliament gave its opinion in a resolution of 24 October 1996.
Discussions continued under the Irish Presidency and finally under the Netherlands Presidency political agreement was reached on 26 May 1997 on the draft before the Council.
On 19 June 1997, the act drawing up the Second Protocol was adopted by the Council and the Second Protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests was signed by the representatives of the Governments of the Member States.
As regards the legal basis for the Second Protocol, reference is made to the remarks under point II of the Explanatory report on the Convention.
The importance of finalising and implementing the Second Protocol is stressed in the action plan to combat organised crime, adopted by the Council on 28 April 1997, which recommends that the Member States widen the scope of the criminalisation of money laundering, further improve and structure cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in the fight against fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Communities and money laundering linked thereto, introduce liability for legal persons involved in organised crime and collect relevant information with respect to legal persons in order to prevent the penetration of organised crime in the legitimate economy.
II.
COMMENTARY ON THE ARTICLES  Article 1 Definitions  1.1.
General remarks  This introductory provision contains five definitions of terms used in the Second Protocol.
Besides defining the exact meaning of the terms for the purpose of the Second Protocol, the first three terms also establish the links between the Second Protocol and the Fraud Convention and the First Protocol thereto.
1.2.
Paragraphs (a) and (b)  These paragraphs formally establish the relationship between the Second Protocol and the Fraud Convention, providing that 'Convention' shall refer to the Fraud Convention and 'fraud' shall refer to the conduct described as such in that Convention.
1.3.
Paragraph (c)  Besides being related to the Fraud Convention, the Second Protocol is also related to the First Protocol thereto, the Corruption Protocol.
The link is emphasised by paragraph (c), which states that, in the context of the Second Protocol, 'passive corruption' and 'active corruption' shall have the same meanings as in the First Protocol.
1.4.
Paragraph (d)  The Second Protocol states that a 'legal person' shall mean any entity having such status under the applicable national law, except for States or other public bodies in the exercise of State authority and for public international organisations.
In this context, 'national law' means the national law of the Member State taking measures against a legal person in accordance with the Second Protocol.
1.5.
Paragraph (e)  For the purpose of the Second Protocol, 'money laundering' is understood as the conduct defined as such in Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering as far as the offences covered by the Fraud Convention and the First Protocol thereto are concerned.
As a result, under the Second Protocol money laundering refers to the proceeds of, at least, serious cases of fraud and the proceeds of active and passive corruption.
Where reference is made to the Directive, in the definition of money laundering, the expression 'property' used in the third indent of Article 1 of the Directive is defined in the fourth indent of the said Article 1.
As a consequence, 'property' in the context of the Second Protocol means 'assets of every kind, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, and legal documents or instruments evidencing title to such assets'.
Article 2 Money laundering  On the basis of this provision, in combination with Article 1(e), Member States are obliged to ensure that the criminal offence of money laundering in their national legislation also includes the offences of fraud, at least in serious cases, and of active and passive corruption as predicate offences.
This extension of the scope of money laundering was encouraged in the action plan to combat organised crime which recommends that the 'criminalisation of laundering of the proceeds of crime should be made as general as possible' (Recommendation 26).
In order to put this recommendation into practice, the Council adopted on 3 December 1998 a joint action on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime, which obliges the Member States to provide for a broad list of predicate offences.
In its second report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the Money Laundering Directive, the Commission announced its intention to propose an extension to the scope of the Money Laundering Directive.
It should be noted that, in order to enable Member States to ratify the Second Protocol where they have not yet been able to implement such an extension, Article 18(1) of the Second Protocol allows a temporary reservation regarding cases other than those related to serious cases of active and passive corruption to be made for a period of five years which may be renewed once.
Article 3 Liability of legal persons  3.1.
General remarks  On the basis of this provision, the law of the Member States must provide that legal persons can be held liable for fraud, active corruption and money laundering committed for their benefit.
Paragraph 1 contains the criteria according to which the legal person's liability must be established for offences committed by persons with certain leading positions, whereas paragraph 2 addresses the possibility of a legal person being held liable for offences committed by other persons within the legal person.
The third paragraph stresses that the liability of a legal person should not exclude the liability of the natural person involved in the commission of the offences for which the legal person is liable.
3.2.
Paragraph 1  According to paragraph 1, liability of a legal person for one of the offences mentioned exists if at least two complementary criteria are met:  (i) the offence involved has been committed for the benefit of the legal person; and (ii) the offence has been committed by a natural person who has a certain leading position within the legal person.
The first criterion creates a link between the offence and the legal person.
The offence must be committed for the benefit of the legal person.
The possible benefit may be directly financial (e.g.
by obtaining the proceeds of EC fraud) or otherwise (e.g.
by receiving orders due to the corruption of an official).
It is not relevant whether the natural person who physically commits the offence is acting individually or as part of an organ of the legal person.
In the second criterion, a relationship is established between the physical offender and the legal person to be held liable for the offence.
It is further stated that the 'leading position' of the natural person may be derived from one or more of the elements mentioned within paragraph 1, which vary from the rather formal to the rather substantial: a power of representation of the legal person, or an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person, or an authority to exercise control within the legal person.
As a result, in order to implement the Second Protocol, Member States will have to insert all three elements in their domestic legislation as alternatives on which the leading position may be based.
As regards cases where the liability of a legal person would be based on the physical offender's authority to exercise control within a legal person, it should be noted that the term 'control' is to be understood in the way that the power of supervision over the legal person's management must be such as to ensure that the physical offender occupies a leading position within the legal person.
Authority to exercise control within the legal person may result in particular from responsibility for internal financial control and auditing or from membership of a controlling or supervisory body internal to the legal person, to the extent that these positions correspond to a leading position which implies a possibility of influencing the legal person's management.
Thus, the power of control vested in persons which implies no possibility of influencing the legal person's management does not count.
Paragraph 1 does not cover external persons auditing accounts of the legal person in question, for example persons from audit companies.
The legal person may also be held liable with respect to the involvement of the natural person referred to in paragraph 1 as an accessory or instigator in the offences, or in the attempted commission of fraud.
3.3.
Paragraph 2  In addition to the cases covered by paragraph 1, Article 3(2) addresses the situation of an offence referred to in paragraph 1 being committed by a person in a position subordinate to the person in a leading position.
Member States are obliged to provide for measures against legal persons in such cases if the commission of the offence has been made possible by the lack of supervision or control by one of the persons in a leading position.
Thus, paragraph 2 does not necessarily imply an objective responsibility on the part of the legal person but the paragraph may be interpreted as being limited to covering cases where the legal person as such may be blamed for culpable behaviour of persons acting on its behalf.
See also point 4.3.
3.4.
Paragraph 3  Article 3(3) provides that criminal proceedings against those natural persons who, de facto, committed the offence should not be excluded by the liability of the legal person.
As a result, measures being taken, for example against a company for whose benefit a fraud was committed by the general manager, shall not exclude criminal prosecution of the manager himself.
Article 4 Sanctions for legal persons  4.1.
General remarks  Article 4 addresses the issue of sanctions against legal persons held liable for the offences referred to in Article 3.
It recognises the different forms of liability dealt with in the first two paragraphs of Article 3, distinguishing the liability for an offence committed by a person in a leading position from that for an offence committed by a subordinate employee.
4.2.
Paragraph 1  In its first paragraph, Article 4 obliges Member States to ensure that legal persons held liable for one of the offences covered by Article 3(1) committed by a person in a leading position may be punished by 'effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions', thus recalling the criteria used in Article 2 of the Fraud Convention and the case-law of the Court of Justice.
According to the Second Protocol, these sanctions must include fines of a criminal or non-criminal nature and may include other sanctions, some of which are suggested in the paragraph.
As for other sanctions, these could, for example, be additional measures such as the exclusion of a legal person from participation in a public tender, as suggested in the resolution of the European Parliament of 24 October 1996.
4.3.
Paragraph 2  Paragraph 2 states that the Member States must also ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions or measures apply to legal persons held liable for fraud, corruption and money laundering pursuant to Article 3(2), i.e.
in cases where the commission of the offence by a subordinate employee was made possible by insufficient supervision or control by a person in a leading position.
For the cases referred to in Articles 3(2) and 4(2), Member States may choose the type and severity of the sanctions or measures, as long as they are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
It should, therefore, be noted that while the measures to be taken under Article 3(2) and 4(2) may be criminal sanctions, administrative and civil law measures are possible as well.
Sanctions or measures contemplated in Article 4(2) of the Second Protocol, even if they need not be provided for in the criminal law or administrative penal legislation of the Member States, should, where appropriate, have a certain punitive character in the sense of going beyond mere reparation of damages or restitution of wrongful enrichment.
Article 5 Confiscation  In order to ensure effective cooperation in the fight against Community fraud and corruption related thereto, it is necessary that the legislation of the Member States allows similar minimum measures to be taken in similar cases regarding the seizure and the confiscation or removal of instruments and proceeds of fraud, active and passive corruption and money laundering.
The reference to removal of instruments and proceeds is intended to cover cases which do not necessarily involve confiscation (for example civil law cases for the purpose of compensation of damages or restitution of the property concerned to its rightful owner).
The seizure, confiscation or removal measures which must be in place may concern the instruments used in order to commit fraud, active or passive corruption or money laundering, and the proceeds of these offences.
Moreover, these measures may also concern property the value of which corresponds to such proceeds.
In this context, the expression 'seizure' covers 'freezing' and 'seizure' as defined in Article 1(I) of the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 19 December 1988).
Bona fide third parties should be protected regarding confiscation and removal of instruments and proceeds.
It follows from the second sentence of Article 5, which provides that the said Member State will act in accordance with its national law, that the question of whether or not a third party is bona fide will be answered according to that law.
Article 6 Tax and customs duty offences  This provision, which deals with non-invocation of the fiscal exception for the purpose of mutual assistance as far as the scope of the Second Protocol is concerned, supplements Article 5(3) of the Fraud Convention.
Whereas the latter excludes the application of the fiscal exception in the context of extradition, Article 6 of the Second Protocol states that mutual legal assistance in criminal matters may not be refused for the mere reason of the offence being tax or duty related.
The provision in itself is an exception to Article 2(a) of the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters (Strasbourg, 20 April 1959) and, although several provisions similar to Article 6 already exist (e.g.
in Article 1 of the Additional Protocol to the 1959 Convention (Strasbourg, 17 March 1978) and Article 50 of the Schengen Implementation Convention (Schengen, 14 June 1990)), it was decided that it should be included in the Second Protocol as well, as none of these instruments were ratified by all Member States at the time of the adoption of the act drawing up the Second Protocol.
As regards the scope of 'tax offences' in this context, this will cover revenue (taxes and duties) within the meaning of the Convention.
Article 7 Cooperation with the Commission of the European Communities  7.1.
General remarks  Article 7 and the Articles which follow it set out the provisions governing cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in the area of the Fraud Convention and the Protocols to it and lay down the obligations resulting from that cooperation for the Commission.
The Member States, as Contracting Parties to the Second Protocol, confer on the Commission a task implying certain commitments by the Commission, not only as regards its relations with the Member States but also as regards its relations with private individuals where data protection is concerned.
The Commission is prepared to carry out this task and it accepts the responsibility incumbent upon it under the relevant provisions of the Second Protocol.
Article 6 of the Fraud Convention provides general rules on cooperation between the Member States regarding cases of fraud detrimental to the European Communities' financial interests.
That provision also applies to the Second Protocol pursuant to Article 12(1) of the Second Protocol.
Article 10 of the Second Protocol lays down the principle of data transfer between the Member States and the Commission for the purposes of applying the Convention.
Article 7 of the Second Protocol follows on from these provisions.
It requires the Member States and the Commission to cooperate with each other in the fight against fraud, active and passive corruption and money laundering.
It makes it clear that not only the Member States, but also the Commission, have a role to play regarding cooperation in the fight against fraud, active and passive corruption and money laundering.
The Commission's role is related to its specific responsibilities and obligations in respect of implementation of the budget and combating fraud against the Communities' financial interests under Articles 205 and 209a of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Article 7 further specifies the rules governing data transfers, which are vital to effective cooperation between the Member States and the Commission.
7.2.
Paragraph 1  (a) This paragraph provides for cooperation between the Member States and the Commission.
Alongside the Member States' primary responsibility for investigations and prosecutions (Article 6 of the Convention) Article 7(1) confers a technical and operational role on the Commission.
The text expresses the concept of partnership in the fight against fraud.
What is concerned here is fraud in the criminal sense.
The following situations are involved where at least two Member States are affected: cases where fraudulent acts are committed on two sides of an international border, cases where a fraudulent act is committed in one Member State but the perpetrators are nationals of more than one Member State or non-member country, cases where a fraudulent act is committed in one Member State but the evidence is spread over more than one Member State or non-member country, cases where the fruits of fraud and property liable to confiscation are to be found outside the country where the fraudulent act is committed, even outside the European Union, cases where, although individual fraudulent acts are committed within a national context, they constitute links in a chain of fraudulent acts organised transnationally.
These situations also apply to corruption and money laundering.
Provision is made for cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in all of them.
(b) The Commission's role is further spelled out in the second subparagraph.
It is provided for the purposes of cooperation that the Commission shall lend its assistance.
Where fraudulent acts are committed in a single Member State, there may nonetheless be links with organised networks in several Member States.
Rapid and fruitful cooperation between the relevant authorities - whether at Member State or Community level - will be conducive to successful investigations and prosecution.
The role conferred on the Commission is defined by the word 'assistance'.
Assistance will depend on the circumstances and requirements of the individual case.
The objective is to add value to the investigations of the facts and to prosecution and conviction where the case is referred to the official national authorities, by ensuring that the necessary skills and know-how are available.
The concept will fall to be interpreted in the broadest sense, without restrictions.
The role conferred on the Commission is clearly without prejudice to the exercise of powers conferred on the Member States' judicial authorities in criminal matters.
The Member States' authorities have access to the full range of national and international legal instruments, including the Convention on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the Protocols to it, to enable them to act against fraud, particularly where organised financial crime is involved.
No change is made to the national and international legal instruments themselves; the provision is solely for Commission assistance in their implementation.
Assistance may be in two forms - technical and operational - which must be distinguished.
(c) Technical assistance corresponds to the value added by the Commission in all areas governed by Community rules.
The documentary and logistical expertise that it can make available in the fight against fraud are significant here.
But so are the full range of its strategic data that can be used to identify current trends regarding fraudulent activities, the typology of fraud perpetrators, both individual and organisations, as well as the risk analyses prompted by the vulnerability to fraud of certain areas of activity.
In logistical terms, the judicial and prosecuting authorities may well need access to the Commission's databases relating to potentially relevant business activities; they cannot consult these without the Commission's assistance.
Technical assistance embraces other forms of support available from the Unit on Coordination of Fraud Prevention's (UCLAF) Criminal Expertise and Liaison Unit, which is experienced in technical legal matters extending to national systems.
All prosecuting authorities will thus have access to that expertise to help them prepare requests to be made to the judicial authorities of one or more other Member States.
(d) Operational assistance relates specifically to on-the-ground activities to combat fraud, corruption and money laundering.
It covers all the contributions the Commission can make to enhancing the effectiveness of enforcement activities to facilitate coordination of investigations undertaken by the national authorities.
Clearly the investigations and prosecutions in the areas referred to in Article 7 are a matter for the Member States' own competent (judicial or other) authorities.
But the Commission's operational assistance can be valuable for the sound performance of investigations, particularly as it can help to: identify and contact the relevant authorities and establish relations for the purposes of information and operations, thus linking the administrative and the criminal investigations, establish or facilitate direct contacts between the relevant authorities involved, organise meetings quickly between the relevant authorities, on request or when the need arises, promote and facilitate relations between the different relevant authorities in the relevant countries in cases of transnational organised fraud, provide the relevant national authorities with the help they need so as to enjoy the quickest and most efficient access to the results of investigations undertaken by the Commission and to the opportunities offered by international administrative cooperation, provide assistance to the relevant national authorities for the purpose of the full exploitation of the possibilities offered by international agreements on judicial cooperation.
This assistance may, where appropriate, include the provision of information for the purpose of the preparation of requests for judicial cooperation, facilitate requisite contacts with the relevant authorities in cases of organised international fraud so as to promote the application of Article 6(2) of the Fraud Convention (centralisation of prosecutions).
7.3.
Paragraph 2  Paragraph 2 provides for exchange of information, subject to protection of the confidentiality of investigations and of personal data.
(a) The purpose of paragraph 2 is to state that in principle there must be no barriers to the exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission, including between Member States via the Commission.
The information exchange presupposes a flow of information in two directions.
The aim of the information exchange is to facilitate evidence of the facts of a case and preventive or enforcement measures in cases of fraud, active and passive corruption and money laundering.
There may be an intensified administrative investigation where there is reason to expect real irregularities; a coherent investigation strategy may also be developed.
The paragraph does not specify the types of information that may be exchanged.
There are no good reasons for restricting them.
Given the wide range of cooperation situations that may arise, information needs will relate to a whole series of practical possibilities depending on the individual case.
The concrete nature of the information will depend on progress in investigations at the time when cooperation commences and, of course, on the specific features of the case in which information is required as a basis for further action.
The information exchanged under paragraph 2 might, for instance, concern: the nature of the fraud and its legal context, the modus operandi, the persons or bodies corporate involved, and personal data more generally.
(b) Paragraph 2 imposes two constraints on information exchanges: data protection and confidentiality of investigations.
Each individual situation will have to be assessed individually on the basis of the circumstances.
Specific provisions of the Second Protocol (Articles 8 to 11) secure the protection of personal data in the information exchange process.
The national law of each Member State will apply to the confidentiality of investigations.
As regards the Commission, Community law provides for the principle of business secrecy (Article 214 of the Treaty establishing the European Community).
Consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis to the specific features and requirements of transnational investigations regarding the Communities' financial interests.
(c) Article 7(2) also allows a Member State which supplies information to set specific conditions concerning the use of the information, whether by the Commission or by another Member State to which the information may be passed.
A Member State may, for example, set out for its competent authorities general or specific provisions which may serve as a basis for specific conditions relating to the use of information which provide a level of protection equivalent to that provided in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and are consistent with the provisions of national law.
In so doing, the Member States should take account on a case-by-case basis of the specific features and requirements of transnational investigations regarding the Communities' financial interests.
Article 8 Data protection responsibility for the Commission  The Commission shall ensure that, in the context of the exchange of information under Article 7(2), it observes, as regards the processing of personal data, a level of protection equivalent to the level of protection set out in Directive 95/46/EC.
A Commission statement entered in the Council minutes when that Directive was adopted stated that the Commission accepted the obligations flowing from the Directive.
The principles expressed in the recitals and the enacting provisions of that Directive will accordingly constitute the framework of legal reference for protection of all the data to which Article 7 applies.
The kind of assistance which the Commission will be able to render to the Member States, as described in the commentary on Article 7, would imply the transfer by Member States of all kinds of data, including personal data, to the Commission and the processing by the latter of such data.
Since it is inevitable that the Commission will process such data by creating its own filing systems, it was felt necessary to introduce provisions in the Protocol to ensure the observance by the Commission of rules on the protection of personal data and the preservation of confidentiality.
These rules will define the conditions under which the processing of personal data by the Commission is lawful, including conditions relating to data quality and legitimacy of data processing, as well as the right of the data subject to have access to, object to or have corrections made to, his personal data.
Article 9 Publication of data protection rules  The rules adopted concerning the obligations under Article 8 will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Data protection rules will thus have mandatory legal effect.
They will be part of Community data-protection law.
In this context it should be pointed out that according to Article 16(4) of the Second Protocol, exchange of information by the Member States with the Commission under Article 7(2) will be suspended if, and for as long as, the rules adopted in conformity with Article 8 have not yet been published in the Official Journal.
Article 10 Transfer of data to other Member States and third countries  10.1.
General remarks  This Article deals with the question under which conditions the Commission may pass on personal data obtained from a Member State pursuant to cooperation under Article 7 to other Member States or third States.
10.2.
Paragraph 1  In principle, there are no barriers to the transfer of information to other Member States, taking into account investigation secrecy and subject to the observance of conditions which the providing Member State may have set as to the use of the information concerned either by the Commission or by Member States to which this information may be passed on.
Before information is transferred, the Member State which supplied the information must be informed of the intended transfer.
It thus has the opportunity to check the conditions (Article 7 (2)) in relation to the intended transfer of information and to check whether the information to be transferred is up to date and accurate.
The Member State should take into account the need for carrying out this verification without delay in order to avoid any unnecessary procedural complications concerning the transfer of information.
10.3.
Paragraph 2  As regards the transfer of personal data by the Commission to third countries, the situation is different: The Commission may only transfer such data to a third country if the providing Member State has given its authorisation to do so.
For example, as is the case under Chapter IV of Directive 95/46/EC, this permits the providing Member State to assess whether the level of protection afforded by the third State concerned in respect of these data is adequate.
Article 11 Supervisory authority  This Article falls to be considered in conjunction with Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC, which provides that in each Member State 'one or more public authorities are responsible for monitoring the application within its territory of the provisions adopted by the Member States in pursuance of this Directive'.
Article 286(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as renumbered by the Amsterdam Treaty, requires the European Parliament and the Council to establish by 1 January 1999 a Community data-protection supervisory authority.
Article 11 of the Second Protocol provides that that authority shall be competent to exercise the same function with respect to personal data held by the Commission by virtue of the Second Protocol.
Article 12 Relation to the Convention  12.1.
Paragraph 1  Paragraph 1 refers to specific provisions of the Fraud Convention declaring them applicable to money laundering as referred to in Article 2 of the Second Protocol.
The relevant provisions of the Convention may be summarised as follows: Article 3 etablishes that business managers may be held criminally liable, Article 5 deals with extradition and the aut dedere aut judicare rule, Article 6 establishes the principle of close cooperation between Member States in cases of fraud against the European Communities' financial interests.
These three principles apply without restriction to the conduct to which Article 2 refers.
12.2.
Paragraph 2  Paragraph 2 provides that certain provisions of the Convention apply to the Second Protocol.
These provisions may be summarised as follows: Article 4 provides rules on jurisdiction regarding the offences concerned.
Declarations made pursuant to Article 4(2) apply to the Second Protocol unless otherwise indicated at the time of ratification of the Second Protocol, Article 7 establishes the ne bis in idem rule, which is also applicable in matters coming under the Second Protocol.
Declarations made pursuant to Article 7(2) apply to the Second Protocol unless otherwise indicated at the time of ratification of the Second Protocol.
It is to be noted that the enforcement of a sentence includes cases where enforcement is suspended on probation, Article 9 allows Member States to enact provisions of national law that are more demanding than those of the Convention.
The Second Protocol likewise constitutes a set of minimum standards, Article 10 establishes, inter alia, arrangements for the provision of information by Member States to the Commission, and it also applies in matters coming under the Second Protocol.
Article 13 Court of Justice  13.1.
General remarks  This Article specifies the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Justice of the European Communities to settle disputes between Member States and between Member States and the Commission relating to the interpretation or application of the Second Protocol, as well as the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Justice regarding preliminary rulings.
13.2.
Paragraphs 1 and 2  Paragraph 1 deals with the conditions under which the Court of Justice is competent regarding disputes between Member States.
Paragraph 2 concerns disputes between Member States and the Commission.
These provisions of the Second Protocol reproduce, as far as possible, the wording of Article 8 of the Fraud Convention, and that of Article 8 of the First Protocol, in order to ensure consistency between the three instruments.
Detailed commentaries are to be found in the Explanatory report to the Convention.
13.3.
Paragraph 3  Paragraph 3 provides that the Protocol of 29 November 1996 on the interpretation, by way of preliminary rulings, by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, of the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, applies to the Second Protocol.
That Protocol also applies to the Convention and the First Protocol.
Declarations made pursuant to the said Protocol are valid in respect of the Second Protocol unless otherwise indicated at the time of ratification of the Second Protocol.
Article 14 Non-contractual liability  This Article confirms that action taken by the Commission under the Second Protocol will be governed by the rules of Community law on the Community's non-contractual liability, set out in Articles 215 and 178 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Since it cannot be excluded that activities of the Commission pursuant to the Second Protocol may give rise to claims for damages by individuals whose personal data are processed by the Commission, it was felt necessary to confirm that also in a case where the Commission acts within powers conferred on it otherwise than by the EC Treaty, it engages the non-contractual liability of the Community in accordance with the terms of Article 215(2) of the EC Treaty.
Moreover, it is clear that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has jurisdiction in disputes relating to compensation for damage caused by the Commission or its servants in the performance of their duties under the Second Protocol.
Article 15 Judicial control  According to Article 22 of Directive 95/46/EC, which deals with data protection, Member States shall provide for the right of every person to a judicial remedy for any breach of the rights guaranteed to him by the national law applicable to the processing of relevant data.
Such rights include a right of access, a right of rectification, erasure or blocking of data when they are incomplete, inaccurate or too old to remain stored and the right to have access to the supervisory authority.
The rules to be adopted pursuant to Article 8 of the Second Protocol will have to include provisions granting such rights to individuals in respect of personal data processed by the Commission.
Under Article 15(1), the Court of Justice of the European Communities is given jurisdiction to deal with applications from natural and legal persons against decisions (which include refusals to take a decision) taken by the Commission on the basis of the rules adopted by it pursuant to Article 8.
It will also be possible for the Court of Justice to assess in this context whether the Commission has fully complied with its obligations under Article 8.
The wording of Article 15(1) draws largely on that of the fourth paragraph of Article 173 of the EC Treaty read also in conjunction with the second paragraph of said Article 173.
The references in Article 15(2) to several other provisions of the EC Treaty are intended to clarify: that the Council may decide, in accordance with the procedure of Article 168a(1) and (2) of the EC Treaty, to confer jurisdiction on the Court of First Instance in cases covered by Article 15(1); the time limits to be observed for bringing a case before the Court of Justice (fifth paragraph of Article 173); the nature of the decision which the Court of Justice may take on an action brought before it (first paragraph of Article 174); the legal effect of a decision of the Court of Justice for the Commission (first and second paragraphs of Article 176); the legal effect of bringing an action before the Court of Justice (Article 185); and that the Court of Justice is entitled to prescribe any interim measures it considers necessary (Article 186).
Article 16 Entry into force  This Article concerns the entry into force of the Second Protocol which may not precede that of the Fraud Convention.
Article 17 Accession of new Member States  This Article concerns the accession of new Member States of the European Union to the Second Protocol.
Article 18 Reservations  18.1.
Paragraph 1  In some Member States, money laundering related to the proceeds of active and passive corruption is a criminal offence only as far as serious cases of corruption are involved.
In order to enable these Member States to ratify the Protocol without delay, they were given the possibility of making a reservation in this area.
To ensure that the necessity for such a reservation will be reconsidered on a regular basis, its validity will be limited to a period of five years from the date of notification that the Protocol has been adopted according to Article 16(2).
After five years, the reservation may be renewed once in order to remain valid.
As a result, after a maximum period of 10 years from the date of the notification of ratification by the last Member State, reservations made with regard to the scope of money laundering will cease to have effect.
18.2.
Paragraph 2  From the beginning of the negotiations on the Second Protocol, the issue of liability and sanctions for legal persons have created problems for Austria, the concept of criminal liability for legal persons being unknown to its legislation.
Because the problem was considered of practical rather than of fundamental nature, it was clear that Austria would need more time to implement Articles 3 and 4 than the other Member States.
To ensure that this specific problem would not delay the eventual entry into force of the entire Protocol for all Member States, and to encourage Austria to adapt its legislation, it was given the possibility of making a five-year reservation on these two Articles.
Unlike the reservation referred to in Article 18(1), this reservation may not be renewed and will lose its validity five years after the Council act drawing up the Protocol was adopted, i.e.
on 19 June 2002.
18.3.
Paragraph 3  Since, according to Article 12(2), Articles 4 and 7 of the Fraud Convention also apply to the Second Protocol, reservations that were accepted under the scope of those provisions of the Convention must apply in the context of the Second Protocol as well.
Any of these reservations may be withdrawn at any time by notice given to the Secretary-General of the Council.
REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL on the modalities of European Union participation in the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption (GRECO)   on the modalities of European Union participation in the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption (GRECO)  INTRODUCTION  As called for by the Stockholm Programme, the Commission submits to the Council this Report on the modalities for the European Union to accede to the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).
GRECO is the most inclusive existing anti-corruption monitoring mechanism at European level, with participation of all EU Member States.
GRECO has had an important role in setting certain minimum European standards for a legal and institutional framework to combat corruption.
Yet corruption still poses serious problems in some Member States and effective results are not achieved consistently across the EU.
This reinforces the Commission's belief that political engagement to fight corruption remains uneven across the EU.
The Communication on an EU policy against corruption recommends EU participation in GRECO, together with the establishment of an EU anti-corruption reporting mechanism.
This should provide the potential to stimulate political will among Member States and render the existing legal and institutional framework more effective.
This Report defines the main objectives of reinforced cooperation between the EU and GRECO and analyses possible ways and benefits for EU's participating in the work of GRECO.
ROLE AND FUNCTIONING OF GRECO  GRECO was set up in 1999 by the Council of Europe, to 'improve the capacity of its members to fight corruption by following up, through a dynamic process of mutual evaluation and peer pressure, compliance with their undertakings in this field'.
GRECO now has 49 members (48 European states and the United States of America).
The work of GRECO is governed by its Statute and Rules of Procedure.
Each member appoints up to two representatives in plenary meetings with the right to vote.
Members also provide GRECO with a list of experts available to carry out evaluations.
Evaluations of GRECO members are divided into rounds and are carried out against the standards set out in the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption, the Civil Law Convention on Corruption and the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption with its Additional Protocol.
GRECO's first evaluation round took place in 2000-2002 and covered the independence, specialisation and means of national bodies engaged in preventing and fighting corruption, as well as the immunities of public officials.
The second evaluation round, conducted in 2003-2006, focused on the seizure and confiscation of corruption proceeds, the prevention and detection of corruption in public administration, and the prevention and fighting of corruption in the private sector.
The third evaluation round, started in January 2007, is still ongoing.
It covers the criminalisation of offences in accordance with the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and political party financing.
Evaluation reports are issued after discussion with the state evaluated and then debated and endorsed by the plenary.
They are as a rule confidential, but may be published with the consent of the evaluated state.
Each report comprises recommendations the country is requested to comply with in a certain period of time (e.g.
18 months).
A compliance procedure is conducted to check the follow-up of the recommendations and ends with the issuing of compliance reports, possibly with addenda.
ADDED VALUE OF EU PARTICIPATION IN THE WORK OF GRECO  The 2007 Memorandum of Understanding between the Council of Europe and the European Union stipulates that legal cooperation covering the rule of law (including fight against corruption) between the two parties should be further developed to ensure coherence between EU law and Council of Europe conventions, although this does not prevent the EU from adopting more far-reaching rules.
EU participation in GRECO was already outlined as a key element of EU anti-corruption policy in the Communication of 28 May 2003.
Following the adoption of the 2003 Communication, different possibilities for participation were explored against the legal competences of the EU under the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Given the then limited Community competence with regard to the Council of Europe's Civil and Criminal Law Conventions on Corruption, a decision had to be postponed until the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty.
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides a more streamlined EU competence on anti-corruption and paves the way for a reinforced EU anti-corruption policy, including participation in the work of GRECO.
Moreover, the path opened by EU accession to the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) would be strengthened by a decision to join the European regional monitoring mechanism.
The main deficiency of anti-corruption policies in the EU-27 is the effective implementation of the existing framework.
GRECO has prompted some action in the EU Member States through its monitoring process, notably in areas less regulated at international level (e.g.
financing of political parties).
However, GRECO's capacity to generate the necessary political will to adopt and maintain robust anti-corruption measures has certain limitations.
Also, GRECO's capacity to signal systemic problems generated by corruption has on some occasions proven rather weak.
The EU's active participation in GRECO's work may thus bring benefits to both organisations, combining GRECO expertise in monitoring anti-corruption efforts and the political role of EU institutions towards an effective enforcement of anti-corruption policies in the EU-27.
To this end, the Commission will set up an EU anti-corruption reporting mechanism.
The EU's participation in GRECO will dovetail the new EU mechanism.
Moreover, the EU's participation in preparing GRECO evaluations may also contribute to improve the methodology and outcome of these evaluations.
Within the EU anti-corruption reporting mechanism the Commission will draw on input from GRECO and other relevant sources including information obtained within the framework of the OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transactions (Anti-Bribery Convention) and the UN Convention against Corruption.
In the light of the above, the following specific objectives would be most relevant for EU participation in GRECO: Involvement in the country visits leading to evaluations of EU Member States and/or candidate countries and potential candidates, should the latter agree; Making suggestions on draft evaluation reports and participation in GRECO plenary debates on the evaluation/compliance reports for EU Member States and/or the candidate countries and potential candidates, should the latter agree; Association with the work of GRECO's Bureau, which has an important role in preparing evaluations and drafting the reports; Contribution to GRECO's budget; Comparative analysis to be carried out by GRECO on the basis of the existing evaluation and compliance reports on the EU Member States as input for the future EU Anti-Corruption Report; Identifying outstanding GRECO recommendations of relevance for the EU, for which the future EU reporting mechanism may provide additional impetus for adequate follow-up.
These specific objectives start from the need to avoid any additional burden on the Member State administrations and duplication of efforts with work already covered by GRECO.
With a view to ensuring reciprocity, the Commission may consider modalities of participation of a GRECO representative in the expert group that will be set up to support the work on the EU Anti-Corruption Report.
MODALITIES OF EU PARTICIPATION IN THE WORK OF GRECO  The legal framework governing GRECO's functioning provides for two forms of association with GRECO's work: observer status and participation, each analysed below.
As regards participation, two alternatives are considered: full membership and membership with limited voting rights.
In addition, the alternative of a joint programme is analysed.
The first assessment below is based on the Commission's analysis of the legal and practical aspects of potential reinforced cooperation with GRECO.
As a next step, the Commission will request from the Council the authorisation to open negotiations for EU participation in GRECO.
Status of observer  Statutory Resolution (93) 28 of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers on partial and enlarged agreements provides for the possibility of certain activities to be carried out by the states parties jointly with one or more non-member states, through enlarged or enlarged partial agreements.
GRECO was created by means of an enlarged partial agreement.
Any non-member of the Council of Europe and any international organisation may be invited by the Committee of Ministers to take part as an observer in the activities of an enlarged partial agreement.
The Resolution does not define the specifics of the rights and obligations of observers in partial and enlarged agreements.
Therefore, the general provisions of Statutory Resolution (93) 26 of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers on observer status apply.
According to these, observer status gives no right to be represented in the Committee of Ministers or the Parliamentary Assembly, unless a specific decision was taken by one of these organs.
GRECO has granted observer status to the OECD and the UN, represented by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
This practice has also been followed in other partial agreements of the Council of Europe.
No budgetary contribution is required from the observer.
While the invitation of the EU to GRECO as an observer can follow observership of other international organisations and has no budgetary implications, the limited scope of such an arrangement and its low added value discourage this option.
Observer status can ensure only limited participation in the evaluation of Member States.
It would not allow for EU involvement in the overall preparation of evaluations and hence not facilitate focusing on matters relevant for the EU.
Consequently, it cannot guarantee the needed input for the future EU Anti-Corruption Report.
Also, it would not fully comply with the Stockholm Programme, which calls for the development of a comprehensive anti-corruption policy in close cooperation with GRECO.
Participation  Statutory Resolution (93) 28 of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers has a broad provision for the (former) European Community's participation in partial and enlarged agreements, stipulating that the modalities of participation are to be determined in the invitation to participate.
GRECO's Statute reiterates this, mentioning that the modalities of the (former) Community's participation in GRECO are to be determined in the resolution inviting it to participate.
GRECO's Rules of Procedure provide in Rule 2 that the (former) European Community may become a 'member' of GRECO through the following means: Upon invitation of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers to participate in GRECO.
To this end, a proposal should be made by GRECO and endorsed by its Statutory Committee.
The formal invitation takes the form of a Resolution adopted by the Committee of Ministers, followed by an agreement with the EU, via an exchange of letters; Accession to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, upon invitation by the Committee of Ministers; Accession to the Civil Law Convention on Corruption.
To date, the EU participates in partial agreements such as the Venice Commission and the Cooperation Group for the prevention of, protection against and organisation of relief in major natural and technological disasters.
The EU is also member of the European Pharmacopoeia Convention and of the European Audiovisual Observatory, as well as participant to a large number of Council of Europe partial agreements.
Given that the GRECO Statute refers to EU participation in GRECO and that the GRECO rules of procedure refer to 'membership', participation therefore assumes a form of membership the details of which are established in a specific agreement.
Consequently, this Report analyses two modalities of participation: full membership (i.e.
full voting rights) and membership with limited voting rights.
Full membership  Full-fledged membership would give the EU voting rights in the GRECO plenary on all matters under GRECO competence (e.g.
evaluation/compliance reports, procedural matters, financial/budgetary issues).
As the EU will not act on behalf of the Member States in the GRECO plenary, it would have one vote, as all other members.
According to Article 8(6) of the GRECO Statute, 'members of GRECO participating in the mutual evaluation shall have the right to vote'.
Although the EU is not party to the Council of Europe's Criminal and Civil Law Conventions on Corruption, according to the GRECO regulatory framework, it may still be evaluated.
The evaluation of the EU institutions would concern mainly the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption and would assume a form of prior endorsement (possibly a unilateral statement) of these principles.
Through accession to UNCAC, a precedent has been created for full-fledged membership of the EU in an organisation that also carries out reviews of its members.
However, in the case of UNCAC, the EU is not currently participating in the mutual review process.
Under this option, the EU would participate fully in the evaluation procedure of Member States, as well as candidate countries, potential candidates, and other third countries.
Consequently, the EU would be able to have a representative nominated in GRECO's Bureau according to the applicable rules (i.e.
rotating basis).
The EU would be member of GRECO's Statutory Committee, which has decision-making powers on budgetary matters.
All other rights and obligations under GRECO's Statute and Rules of Procedure would apply to the EU.
The EU would become a contributor to the GRECO budget.
The impact assessment accompanying the Commission Decision on the setting up of an EU reporting mechanism for periodical evaluation estimated the potential financial costs of EU participation in GRECO at about 450,000 Euros per year.
This would cover the contribution to the GRECO budget (i.e.
around 300,000 euros for a major contributor) and the cost of activities not currently carried out by GRECO that would mainly benefit the EU (e.g.
comparative reports and identification of outstanding recommendations for the EU-27).
Such activities may be financed, for example, via service contracts or action grants.
This option has a high potential to meet all the specific objectives mentioned in section 3.
It would also ensure: high visibility of the EU-GRECO cooperation; complementarity between GRECO and the future EU reporting mechanism; potential to ensure further improvements in the GRECO evaluation system; greater focus on EU policy areas.
However, evaluation of EU institutions by GRECO is an endeavour that needs to be assessed in more depth in terms of requisites, feasibility and potential impact, the GRECO evaluation system being geared to countries rather than organisations.
While some of the Twenty Guiding Principles may be applied to organisations as well (e.g.
integrity in public administration), an evaluation under the current GRECO procedures would not be comprehensive and its added value rather unclear for both GRECO and the Union.
Without the evaluation of EU institutions by GRECO, the EU would not have full voting rights in the GRECO plenary.
Membership with limited voting rights  GRECO Statute stipulates that the modalities of the EU's participation will be determined in the resolution inviting it to participate, without any specific indication as to the type of participation.
Thus, EU participation may also take the form of membership with limited voted rights.
Such an alternative may not require evaluation of the EU by GRECO, but would imply the creation of a framework for a further joint assessment by the two organisations of the requisites, feasibility and potential impact of the evaluation of EU institutions, taking account of the specificities and competences of the EU.
However, in its 50th meeting, the GRECO plenary stressed that, while acknowledging that special arrangements might be necessary to accommodate to the particularities of the EU, the evaluation of EU institutions by GRECO must be more than just a remote possibility (i.e.
the assessment would need to progressively lead to EU's evaluation).
Under this option, the EU becomes a contributor to the GRECO budget, with a slightly reduced contribution than in the case of full membership.
The EU would have the right to vote on procedural, financial and budgetary issues.
It would have no right to vote in the GRECO plenary on the adoption of evaluation and compliance reports, no representative in the GRECO's Bureau and would not participate in the elections for president and vice-president.
The EU would appoint representatives to the GRECO plenary, participate in its debates, make recommendations on evaluation/compliance reports, and possibly have a representative participating as an observer in the country visits in the Member States, candidate countries, potential candidates, and other states accepting such participation.
The EU would be able to formulate suggestions as to the organisation of evaluations and their follow-up.
The practical arrangements for EU participation in GRECO would be reviewed by the Commission jointly with GRECO on a periodical basis (e.g.
every 5 years), and potential amendments may be adopted by mutual agreement between GRECO and the EU.
This option would ensure input to the future EU Anti-Corruption Report: i.e.
a comparative analysis carried out by GRECO based on the existing evaluation and compliance reports on Member States and flagging of the most relevant outstanding recommendations.
It would largely meet the specific objectives mentioned in section 3, allowing EU participation in the evaluation of Member States.
Although it would not have any decision-making power in the evaluation process, the EU may be actively involved in implementation and prompt actions which may ensure additional focus on policy areas more relevant for the EU.
Cooperation between GRECO and the EU would gain political weight, and duplication would be avoided.
The issue of the evaluation of EU institutions by GRECO would need to be clarified as a matter of priority in negotiations.
The advantages of a simplified form of participation are however clearer where the EU would not be required to commit to the evaluation of its institutions.
Joint programme  This would assume EU financial assistance to GRECO in the form of a grant for the delivery of specific predefined results and may span a set period of time (2-3 years), with the possibility of periodical renewal.
Such a solution for targeted cooperation between the EU and GRECO has already been implemented.
For example, the Council of Europe participates in the Eastern Partnership as a privileged partner, supporting with its expertise the EU and the Eastern Partnership countries.
To give some political weight to the partnership, a Memorandum of Understanding or an agreement may be concluded with GRECO, as in the case of the agreement between the Council of Europe and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights.
As to objectives, a joint programme may ensure input from GRECO to the future EU Anti-Corruption Report, notably through comparative analysis of existing GRECO evaluation/compliance reports on Member States and flagging of outstanding recommendations.
This would also avoid duplication.
The budget involved would be lower than that needed for membership with limited voting rights (i.e.
roughly around 200-250,000 Euros per year, covering the drafting of comparative reports, logistical costs, workshops, etc.).
However, a joint programme, while meeting some of the specific objectives, would not meet the overall objective of creating synergies between GRECO expertise and EU political leverage.
Partnership between the two organisations would be less visible and EU involvement in GRECO's evaluations would be less active.
This option might be perceived as a purely technical solution, with the EU acting more as a contractor rather than a partner.
It would thus have less added value than participation in GRECO.
CONCLUSION  The Council is invited to consider the options identified in this Report.
Taking into account the increased competences of the EU and the need for a comprehensive EU policy against corruption, participation in GRECO (i.e.
membership) is, in Commission's view, the appropriate way forward to meet the objectives set by the Stockholm Programme .
As the future EU reporting mechanism aims to measure anti-corruption efforts in Member States, with a view to identifying EU trends and proposing policy and legal action at EU level, participation in GRECO would facilitate the monitoring task.
Cooperation would be more visible and the risk of overlapping avoided.
In addition, participation as a full-fledged member or a member with limited voting rights would ensure good use of the mutual benefits of GRECO's expertise in monitoring anti-corruption efforts and the EU's political leverage over the Member States.
It is thus likely to contribute, jointly with the future EU reporting mechanism, to creating a momentum for more effective enforcement of anti-corruption policies in the EU-27.
The Commission has held some preliminary discussions with the GRECO Secretariat, with a view to identifying the main matters of interest and potential alternatives in terms of the legal and practical feasibility of EU participation in GRECO.
In terms of practical feasibility, membership with limited voting rights would seem a possible and suitable option to be considered in negotiations.
However, a key issue to be addressed under this option is the evaluation of EU institutions by GRECO, whereby evaluation of EU institutions would commend full membership.
The actual modalities of EU participation in GRECO (e.g.
form of participation, participation in the Council of Europe bodies, practical arrangements, budgetary contribution) would have to be carefully negotiated with GRECO.
To this end, the Commission will request the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations for the EU's participation in GRECO .
Negotiations would be conducted in the light of the general principles of cooperation between the EU and the Council of Europe, namely: specificity and limits of the EU's competence.
It should however allow the EU to establish higher standards within its borders; privileged working relationship to ensure a coordinated approach at European level towards corruption.
For the EU, access to the early stages of evaluation rounds and the drafting of country reports, as well as the comparative analysis of Member States' evaluations and the flagging of outstanding recommendations, would be essential.
In turn, EU membership would enhance the visibility of GRECO a nd provide an opportunity for GRECO recommendations to be considered and where relevant followed up within the EU anti-corruption reporting mechanism.
Finally, apart from the agreement with the GRECO plenary, the potential participation of the EU in GRECO requires endorsement by the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, which is the initiator of the formal participation procedure.
Accordingly, the Communication on EU policy against corruption calls upon Member States to fully support, within the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, the EU's application for participation in GRECO .

ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned  1805 Security and Safeguarding Liberties  Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.
The EU Anti-Corruption Report will assess periodically the anti-corruption efforts in the EU27.
It will provide a clear picture of the state of play in the Union, and identify weak spots and EU trends, with the view to prompt additional political will of the Member States to adress corruption and to prepare future EU policy actions.
EU participation in GRECO would ensure that synergies are created between the two mechanisms.
Indicators of results and impact  Specify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.
The EU Anti-Corruption Report will be managed by the Commission and published every two years.
The Commission will be assisted by an expert group, a network of local research correspondents and civil society assessments.
The Commission will constantly supervise the activity of the experts and the input of the research correspondents and civil society.
At each assessment round the follow-up of the recommendations of previous reports will be scrutinised.
Following the adoption of the Report on modalities of EU participation in GRECO, the Commission will ask the Council to authorize the opening of negotiations with the Council of Europe.
In case of EU participation in GRECO, the Commission intends to review the practical arrangements for participation on a regular basis (e.g.
every 5 years), based on the results of the reinforced cooperation.
Grounds for the proposal/initiative  Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term  The Commission will select at each assessment round a number of cross-cutting elements relevant at EU level at a given moment, as well as aspects specific to each Member State.
These will be assessed against certain indicators , some selected in line with already existing standards, and some newly developed.
The Commission will be assisted by: an expert group set up by a separate Commission Decision (to be adopted soon after the anti-corruption package) advising on: indicators, assessment of Member States' performance, identifying best practices and EU trends, recommendations, and potential EU proposals; a network of local research correspondents, set up by the Commission through procurement procedures and formed of civil society and academia, that will collect relevant information in each Member State; civil society assessments (to be contracted through targeted calls for proposals) .
The civil society organisations will be encouraged to apply for subject specific assessments of Member States' anti-corruption efforts.
The development of an experience sharing programme may be considered to help Member States, local NGOs or other stakeholders to identify best practices and shortcomings, raise awareness or provide training.
The decision to set up such programme and the details of its functioning may only be taken/clarified at a later stage, once the preparations for the first Report are more advanced.
Added value of EU involvement  The Stockholm Programme recognises corruption as a trans-national threat that challenges EU internal security.
There is a need for action at EU level, since the problems associated with corruption cannot be adequately solved by Member States alone.
Enhancing fight against corruption is also relevant for policy areas where large amounts of EU resources are involved.
The EU has the required political leverage and is therefore better placed to act as a catalyst for boosting the anti-corruption policy of the EU and Member States.
Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  To date there is no mechanism in place at EU level to measure in a coherent manner the enforcement of anti-corruption policies.
The only EU monitoring tool that also covers anti-corruption issues is the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism for Romania and Bulgaria which has managed over time to maintain or revive a certain momentum for reforms.
Based on annual assessments, indices and qualitative judgments, the work of civil society organisations, like Transparency International, placed corruption squarely on the political agenda in many countries worldwide and generated political pressure for reforms.
At international level, the main existing evaluation mechanisms (e.g.
GRECO, the OECD Working Group on Bribery and the UN Convention against Corruption), in spite of obvious benefits, have also proven their limitations, notably as regards prompting additional political will at national level.
The EU has a unique leverage to generate this political will.
The new EU Anti-Corruption Report will strive to be fact-oriented, focused, outspoken, and flexible.
Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments  The EU anti-corruption package is part of the wider Commission's strategic initiative on the protection of licit economy which also comprises the new Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy and the asset recovery legislative initiative.
The current proposal is fine-tuned with both.
Implementation with a start-up period from the date of the adoption of Commission Decision in the case of the EU Anti-Corruption Report and from the date of EU accession act in case of EU participation in GRECO.

Third-party contributions  The proposal/initiative does not provide for co-financing by third parties  The proposal/initiative provides for the co-financing estimated below:  GRECO evaluations have led to important changes in the legal and institutional setting for the financing of political parties in some EU Member States (Slovenia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia).
For example, the 2005 GRECO evaluation report did not alert to the seriousness of the systemic problems that generated a chain of corruption scandals linked with the financial crisis that emerged soon afterwards.
The Bureau is composed of GRECO's President and Vice-President, and five other representatives of the GRECO members entitled to vote.
The Bureau prepares the draft annual programme of activities and the draft annual activity report, makes proposals on the draft budget, organises country visits, proposes the composition of evaluation teams, prepares the agenda for the GRECO plenary, and proposes the provisions to be selected for evaluation.
The comparative analysis would assume additional work for the GRECO Secretariat.
However, it will be based on the existing evaluation/compliance reports.
It will not bring an additional evaluation step.
It will only assess what has been already produced by GRECO.
Since membership with limited voting rights assumes a more limited participation in the evaluation process, the costs entailed by these activities will be deducted from the EU contribution to the GRECO budget (i.e.
the contribution would be lower than 300,000 Euros per year).

ACT  Council Decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.
SUMMARY  At the conference held in Merida (Mexico) from 9 to 11 December 2003, the United Nations Convention against Corruption was opened for signing.
At its 2658th session on 10 May 2005, the Council adopted the Commission proposal concerning the signing of the Convention.
The Decision authorises the President of the Council to designate the persons empowered to sign the United Nations Convention on behalf of the European Community.
On 15 September 2005, the European Commission and the Council Presidency signed the Convention on behalf of the European Community.
The Convention, now known as the Merida Convention, was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 31 October 2003 (Resolution 58/4) and was open for signing until 9 December 2005.
Producing an effective instrument against corruption  In December 2000, the UN General Assembly decided to establish a special committee open to all States for drawing up an effective international legal instrument against corruption (Resolution 55/61).
The committee negotiated the Convention between January 2002 and October 2003.
The Commission represented the European Community's interests.
The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been attained.
The Convention provides for a high standard of preventive and technical assistance measures in matters within the Community's powers, in particular with regard to the internal market.
This includes measures to prevent and to combat money laundering, as well as standards on accounting in the private sector and on transparency and equal access of all candidates for public works supply and service contracts.
As the Member States stated that they would sign the Convention as soon as it was opened for signing in Merida, Mexico (Spain alone of the EU15 not having done so), the Commission asserts that the European Community should also do so.
To that end, the Commission proposed that the Presidency of the Council designate the persons empowered to sign the Convention on behalf of the European Community.
The Council adopted the Commission proposal without debate.
Fighting corruption: the UN Convention  The purposes of the Convention are to: promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat corruption more efficiently and effectively; promote, facilitate and support international cooperation and technical assistance; promote integrity, accountability and proper management of public affairs and public property.
It applies to the prevention, investigation and prosecution of corruption and to the freezing, seizure, confiscation and return of the proceeds of offences.
The Convention enumerates in detail the measures to prevent corruption, including the application of prevention policies and practices, the establishment of bodies for that purpose, the application of codes of conduct for public officials and objective criteria for the recruitment and promotion of civil servants, and public procurement.
It recommends promoting transparency and accountability in the management of public finances and in the private sector, with tougher accounting and auditing standards.
Measures to prevent money-laundering are also provided for, together with measures to secure the independence of the judiciary.
Public reporting and the participation of society are encouraged as preventive measures.
Regarding criminalisation, detection and repression, the Convention recommends the State Parties to adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish a whole series of criminal offences.
These are: corruption of national or foreign public officials and officials of public international organisations; embezzlement, misappropriation or other diversion by a public official of any public or private property; trading in influence; abuse of functions and illicit enrichment.
In all respects, the Convention regards as corruption the offer or acceptance of undue advantages for oneself or for another person or entity.
In the private sector, it calls for the creation of offences of embezzlement and corruption.
There would also be offences of laundering the proceeds of crime, handling stolen property, obstructing the administration of justice, and participating in and attempting embezzlement or corruption.
The State Parties are recommended to take the necessary measures to: provide for the liability of legal persons; allow the freezing, seizure and confiscation; protect witnesses, experts and victims; protect reporting persons; tackle the consequences of acts of corruption; ensure that entities or persons who have suffered damage as a result of an act of corruption have the right to initiate legal proceedings for compensation; establish a body or bodies or appoint persons specialised in combating corruption through law enforcement; encourage cooperation with law enforcement authorities; encourage cooperation between national authorities and with the private sector; overcome obstacles that may arise out of the application of bank secrecy laws; take account of the previous convictions of an alleged offender in another State for the purpose of criminal proceedings; establish their jurisdiction over offences committed on their territory, or against them, or by one of their nationals etc.
State Parties are also to take the necessary measures concerning proceedings and penalties against public officials, so as to strike a balance between their immunities and the offences committed by them, including the ensuing consequences.
The Convention devotes a chapter to international cooperation.
The State Parties are to cooperate on criminal matters and on matters of extradition and transfer of sentenced persons, in a variety of situations described by the Convention.
Mutual judicial assistance is a major item in this chapter and the Convention considers a variety of scenarios to provide for the largest range of possibilities for assistance.
The State Parties can also transfer criminal proceedings when necessary, conduct joint investigations and make use of special investigative techniques such as electronic surveillance.
Enforcement authorities are called on to cooperate with each other through more effective channels of communication and cooperation when conducting investigations.
Chapter V concerns asset recovery.
The return of assets pursuant to this chapter is a fundamental principle of the Convention.
Financial institutions are encouraged to verify the identity of customers and beneficial owners of high-value accounts and to avoid banks that have no physical presence and are not affiliated with a regulated financial group.
The chapter further specifies measures to be taken for the direct recovery of assets and the machinery for doing this by means of international cooperation on confiscation.
Such assets should be returned in accordance with the rules laid down by the Convention.
A financial intelligence unit and bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements to enhance the effectiveness of international cooperation are also called for.
State Parties are required to develop specific training programmes and provide one another the widest measure of technical assistance.
The collection, exchange and analysis of information on corruption is provided for, as are practical measures to enhance cooperation at various levels, as well as financial and material assistance to support the efforts of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to prevent and fight corruption effectively.
A conference of the State Parties is established to improve their capacity and cooperation, in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the Convention and to promote and review its implementation.
The Convention is open for signature by regional economic integration organisations, provided that at least one Member State of such an organisation has signed it.
It is to enter into force on the 90th day after the date of deposit of the 30th instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.

3.4 BLADE-ELEMENT THEORY The momentum theories, which have been developed in the previous sections, are based on a consideration of the mean axial and rotational velocity in the slipstream and determine the thrust and torque of a blade from the rate of decrease of momentum of the fluid.
The theories determine an upper limit to the power coefficient of any blade, depending on the free-stream wind velocity and on the power extracted, but they restrict the understanding of the effect of rotor geometry (i.e.
blade airfoil section, chord and twist).
The blade-element theory is an alternative method of analyzing the behavior of blades due to their motion through air.
As shown in Figure 3.7, for this analysis, it is assumed that the blade is divided into N sections (or elements) and the aerodynamic force acting on each blade element can be estimated as the force on suitable airfoil characteristics of the same cross-section adopted for the blade elements.
Finally assuming that the behavior of each element is not affected by the adjacent elements of the same  44  blade, the force on the whole blade can be derived by adding the contributions of all the elements along the blade.
Figure 3.7 Schematic of blade elements  A diagram showing the developed blade element at radius r and the velocities and forces acting on this element is given in Figure 3.8.
The relative wind velocity U rel is the vector sum of the wind velocity at the rotor U ∞ (1 - a ) (the vector sum of the free-stream wind velocity, U ∞ and the induced axial velocity -aU ∞ ) and the wind velocity due to rotation of the blade.
And this rotational component is the vector sum of the blade section velocity, Ω r and the induced angular velocity a′ Ω r .
Hence the relative wind velocity will be as shown on the velocity diagram in Figure 3.8.
The minus sign in the term U ∞ (1 - a) is due to the retardation of flow while the air approaching the rotor and the plus sign in the term Ωr (1 + a′ ) as shown in Figure 3.8 is due to the flow of air in the reverse direction of blade rotation after air particles hit the blades and so give torque.
In the mean time let the existence of the axial and angular induction factors assumed, their evaluation will be given in the subsequent section.
45  Figure 3.8 Blade Geometry for analysis of a HAWT  From Figure 3.8 the following relationships can be determined;  U rel =  U ∞ (1 - a ) sin(ϕ )  (3.3.1)  tan(ϕ ) =  U ∞ (1 - a ) (1 - a ) = Ω r (1 + a′) (1 + a′)λr 1 2 ρU rel cdr 2  (3.3.2)  dFD = CD  (3.3.3)  46  1 2 dFL = CL ρU rel cdr 2  (3.3.4)  dT = dFL cos ϕ + dFD sin ϕ  (3.3.5)  dL = dFL sin ϕ - dFD cos ϕ  (3.3.6)  If the rotor has B number of blades, the total normal and tangential force on the element at a distance r by rearranging equation 3.3.5 and 3.3.6 with the use of equation 3.3.1, 3.3.3 and 3.3.4;  1 2 dT = B ρU rel (CL cos ϕ + CD sin ϕ )cdr 2  (3.3.7)  1 2 dL = B ρU rel (CL sin ϕ - CD cos ϕ )cdr 2  (3.3.8)  The elemental torque due to the tangential forces, dL operating at a distance r from the center is given by;  dQ = rdL  (3.3.9)  hence the elemental torque by inserting equation 3.3.8 into equation 3.3.9;  1 2 dQ = B ρU rel (CL sin ϕ - CD cos ϕ )crdr 2  (3.3.10)  From the velocity diagram in Figure 3.8, relative wind velocity can be written as below;  47  U rel =  U ∞ (1 - a ) sin ϕ  (3.3.11)  and by defining solidity ratio, σ as following;  σ=  Bc 2π r  (3.3.12)  and inserting equations 3.3.11 and 3.3.12 into equations 3.3.7 and 3.3.10, the general form of elemental thrust and torque equations become; 2 U ∞ (1 - a) 2 dT = σπρ (CL cos ϕ - CD sin ϕ )rdr sin 2 ϕ  (3.3.13)  dQ = σπρ  2 U ∞ (1 - a ) 2 (CL sin ϕ - CD cos ϕ )r 2 dr 2 sin ϕ  (3.3.14)  Thus, from blade element theory, two equations (3.3.13 and 3.3.14) have been obtained.
They define the normal force (thrust) and the tangential force (torque) on an annular rotor section as a function of the flow angles at the blades and airfoil characteristics.
Here it is convenient to consider in turn the following assumptions which are the bases of developing blade element theory [11]:  • The assumption that the behavior of an element is not affected by the adjacent elements of the same blade  • The airfoil characteristics to be adopted for the element  48  The independence of blade elements, assumed in the blade element theory and also in all later developments of theory, is analogous to the assumption adopted in the general momentum theory that the thrust on an elementary annulus of a rotor may be expressed as dT = 2 ρ u (u - U ∞ )dA (equation 3.2.15).
In the discussion of general momentum theory it was pointed out that this equation could not be established rigorously.
Similarly, in the blade element theory, it is not possible to give a rigorous proof of the independence of the blade elements and the validity of the assumption must be justified by an appeal to suitable experimental results.
If the assumption valid, the thrust on the blade element at radial distance r with the blade angle θ should be independent of the variation of the blade angle along the remainder of the blade.
A check of the assumption can therefore be obtained by taking two propellers of different pitch with blades of the same plan form and section and by rotating the blades of one rotor so that the blade angles of the two rotors have the same value at a chosen radial distance r .
The thrust distribution along the blades should then show the same element of thrust on the blade elements under examination.
By means of a series of experiments [12] has been established the independence of the blade elements over the principal part of the blades.
The second assumption states that two-dimensional airfoil characteristics can be used for the blade elements.
Airfoil two-dimensional characteristics are usually determined from tests of a rectangular airfoil of different aspect ratio.
Hence the lift and drag characteristics are dependent on aspect ratio.
But in the fully-attached regime, airfoil section characteristics are not generally affected by aspect ratio, and since HAWT rotors operate in the fully-attached regime of the flow while extracting maximum energy from the wind, two-dimensional (i.e.
infinite aspect ratio) can be used in predicting performance.
However, when two-dimensional data are used, a tip-loss factor must be added as will be described in the next chapter.49  3.5 BLADE ELEMENT-MOMENTUM (BEM) THEORY In the general momentum theory attention was directed to the motion of the fluid and the forces acting on the blades were determined.
The defect of the general momentum theory was that it gave no indication of the shape of blade required to produce the reactions considered.
The principle of the blade element theory was to consider the forces experienced by the blades of the rotor in their motion through the air and this theory was therefore intimately concerned with the geometrical shape of the blade.
In order to bridge the gap between these two theories, the blade element momentum theory (BEM) which is also known as strip theory has been developed.
BEM theory relates rotor performance to rotor geometry and particularly important prediction of this theory is the effect of finite blade number.
The assumptions for BEM theory are obviously the combination of those which were made for general momentum and blade element theory.
The foremost assumption in BEM theory is that individual streamtubes (the intersection of a streamtube and the surface swept by the blades) can be analyzed independently of the rest of the flow as assumed before for the blade element theory.
A second assumption associated with the development of BEM theory is that  spanwise flow is negligible, and therefore airfoil data taken from two-dimensional section tests are acceptable as assumed before in again blade element theory.
A third assumption is that flow conditions do not vary in the circumferential direction, i.e.
axisymmetric flow.
With this assumption the streamtube to be analyzed is a uniform annular ring centered on the axis of revolution as assumed before in general momentum theory.
BEM theory refers to the determination of a wind turbine blade performance by combining the equations of general momentum theory and blade element  50  theory.
In this case by equating the elemental thrust force equations from general momentum theory and blade element theory (equations 3.2.15 and 3.3.13 respectively) the following relationship is obtained;  a cos ϕ = (σ CL ) [1 + (CD CL ) tan ϕ ] (1 - a ) 4sin 2 ϕ  (3.4.1)  and equating the elemental torque derived in both general momentum theory and blade element theory (equations 3.2.18 and 3.3.14 respectively);  a′ (σ CL ) = [1 - (CD CL )cot ϕ ] (1 - a ) 4λr sin ϕ  (3.4.2)  Equation 3.4.2 can be rearranged by using equation 3.3.2, which relates  a, a′ , ϕ and λr based on the geometric considerations;  a′ (σ CL ) = [1 - (CD CL )cot ϕ ] (1 + a′) 4cos ϕ  (3.4.3)  In the calculation of induction factors a and a′ , accepted practice is to set CD zero for the purpose of determining induction factors independently from airfoil characteristics.
For airfoils with low drag coefficient, this simplification introduces negligible errors [13].
So equation 3.4.1, 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 can be rewritten considering CD ≈ 0  a cos ϕ = (σ CL ) (1 - a ) 4sin 2 ϕ  (3.4.4)  51  a′ (σ CL ) = (1 - a ) 4λr sin ϕ a′ (σ CL ) = (1 + a′) 4cos ϕ  (3.4.5)  (3.4.6)  By using these three equations the following useful relationships result after some algebraic manipulation;  CL =  4sin ϕ (cos ϕ - λr sin ϕ ) σ (sin ϕ + λr cos ϕ )  (3.4.7)  a=  1 1 + [4sin ϕ (σ CL )cos ϕ ]   2  (3.4.8)  a′ =  1 [[4cosϕ (σ CL )] - 1]  (3.4.9)  a a′ = λr tan ϕ  (3.4.10)  To determine the power coefficient of a wind turbine, the power contribution from each annulus is found firstly, then integrated along the blade length and finally using the equation 2.5.1, power coefficient C p can be obtained.
The elemental power from each blade element was defined in equation 3.2.19 as;  dP = Ω dQ  (3.2.19)  52  And the total power from the rotor is;  P = ∫ dP = ∫ Ω dQ rh rh  R  R  (3.2.20)  Hence the power coefficient C p becomes by rewriting equation 2.5.1 here,  ∫ Ω dQ P rh Cp = = 3 3 1/ 2 ρU ∞ A 1/ 2 ρU ∞π R 2  R  (3.4.11)  Using the expression for the elemental torque from equation 3.3.14, the power coefficient can be expressed as below,  (1 - a ) 2 C p = 2 ∫ σ CL [1 - (CD CL )cot ϕ ] λr2d λr sin ϕ λ 2  (3.4.12)  Finally by using equations 3.4.4 and 3.4.10 in equation 3.4.12, the general form of power coefficient expression can be obtained as;  Cp =  8  λ  2  ∫ λ a′(1 - a)[1 - (C λ 3 r h  λ  D  CL )cot ϕ ] d λr  (3.4.13)  Note that when CD ≈ 0 , the equation above for C p is the same as the one derived from the general momentum theory (equation 3.2.22).
An alternative expression for the power coefficient can be derived after performing the tedious algebra and by inserting equations 3.4.7 and 3.4.8 into equation 3.4.12;  53  Cp =  ∫ λ 2 λ λr2 d λr h  8  λ  sin 2 ϕ ( cos ϕ - λr sin ϕ )( sin ϕ + λr cos ϕ ) 1 - ( CD CL ) cot ϕ  ...   (3.4.14)  Note that even though the axial and angular induction factors were determined assuming the CD = 0 , the drag is included in the power coefficient calculation.
By the same token, the thrust coefficient CT can be found beginning from the definition of thrust coefficient in the equation 2.5.3 as following;  CT =  ∫ λ 2 λ λr d λr h  4  λ  sin 2ϕ ( cos ϕ - λr sin ϕ )( sin ϕ + λr cos ϕ ) 1 + ( CD CL ) tan ϕ  ...   (3.4.15)  3.6 VORTEX THEORY In addition to BEM theory which will be used for rotor performance analysis and blade design of HAWT in this thesis; vortex theory is an alternative theory which provides a method of analyzing the rotor performance.
Even though vortex theory is not the scope of this thesis there is a necessity of discussing of this theory briefly without going into its detail.
Because the vortex theory explains the origin of axial and angular induction factors which have been already introduced in both general momentum theory and blade element theory without giving any physical meaning about their existence.
The vortex theory depends fundamentally on the conception that the lift of an airfoil section is associated with a circulation of the flow around its contour.
According to modern airfoil theory the lift L per unit length of an airfoil section in two-dimensional motion is related to the circulation Γ around its contour by the following equation;  54  L = ρU Γ  (3.5.1)  Applying this concept of airfoil theory to the problem of the rotor blades, it is evident that there must be circulation of the flow around the blades of the rotor in order to produce the aerodynamic force experienced by the blades.
In general the circulation Γ around the blade element will vary along the blade, but to explain the mode of action of the blades it is simpler to assume as a first step that the circulation is constant along the whole blade.
The existence of this circulation can be expressed also by the statement that there is a vortex line of strength Γ , bound to the blade and running along it from root to tip.
But a vortex line can not begin or end abruptly; unless it forms a closed curve in the body, it must be continued as a free vortex line in the fluid and in this latter form it follows the general motion of the fluid as a trailing vortex behind the body.
Thus the bound vortex must be continued by two free vortices in the fluid, one springing from the root of the blade and the other from its tip.
As shown in Figure 3.9 the free vortex springing from the roots of propeller blades will be straight line along the axis of the propeller and its strength will be BΓ for a propeller with B blades.
The tip vortices, each of strength Γ , will be of helical shape and will be tracing out the paths described by the tips of the propeller blades.
Figure 3.9 Tip and root vortices  55  Up to this point the vortex system of a rotor or propeller has been based for simplicity on the assumption that the circulation along the blade is constant.
More generally, however, the strength of the circulation will vary along the blade and indeed the condition of constant circulation along the whole blade is physically impossible.
Because the pressure difference between the top and bottom surface of the blade causes flow and pressure equalization near the blade tips.
For an illustration the actual variation of the circulation along the blade is given in Figure 3.10.
Due to the variation of the circulation along the blade, trailing vortices will arise, not only at the root and tip of the blade, but from every point of its trailing edge, forming a continual screwlike vortex sheet.
Figure 3.10 Variation of bound circulation along blade length  If δΓ is the increase of circulation between the points r and (r + δ r ) of the blade, then the strength of the helical vortex springing from this element will be -δΓ .
The vortex line springing from one blade form a vortex sheet in the form of  a screw surface and there will be one such surface for each blade.
The slipstream of the rotor consists of these vortex sheets and of the fluid contained between them.Referring to the Figure 3.5, let r be the radial distance of any annular element of the rotor plane, and let u and v be respectively the inflow (the flow immediately in front of the rotor plane) axial and radial components of the fluid velocity.
Let pu be the inflow pressure and let p' be the decrease of outflow (the flow immediately behind the rotor plane) pressure associated with an angular velocity w. In the final wake let pw be the pressure, uw be the axial velocity and ww be the angular velocity at a radial distance rw from the axis of the slipstream.
By applying the condition of continuity of flow for the annular element is;  uwrwdrw = urdr  (3.2.1)  And the condition for constancy of angular momentum of the fluid as it passes down the slipstream is; 2 ww rw = wr 2  (3.2.2)  Also since the element of torque of the radial blade element is equal to the angular momentum extracted in unit time to the corresponding annular element of the slipstream;  35  dQ = ρ uwr 2 dA Where dA = 2π rdr  (3.2.3)  For constructing the energy equation, Bernoulli's equation can be used separately from free-stream to inflow conditions and from outflow to wake conditions;  1 2 H o = po + ρU ∞ 2 1 = pu + ρ ( u 2 + v 2 ) 2 1 H1 = pd + ρ ( u 2 + v 2 + w2 r 2 ) 2 1 2 2 2 = pw + ρ ( uw + wwrw ) 2 Hence  1 H o - H1 = p′ - ρ ( w2 r 2 ) 2  (3.2.4)  Equation 3.2.4 shows that the decrease of total pressure head passing through the blade element is below the thrust per unit area p′ by a term representing the kinetic energy of the rotational motion imparted to the fluid by the torque of the blade.
The expressions for the total pressure head also give;  po - pw =  1 1 2 2 2 ρ ( uw - U ∞ ) + ρ wwrw2 + ( H 0 - H1 ) 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 = ρ ( uw - U ∞ ) + ρ ( ww rw - w2 r 2 ) + p′ 2 2  (3.2.5)  To find the pressure drop, p′ Bernoulli's equation can be applied between inflow and outflow relative to the blades which are rotating with an angular 36  velocity Ω .
Note that the flow behind the rotor rotates in the opposite direction to the rotor, in reaction to the torque exerted by the flow on the rotor.
Hence the angular velocity of the air relative to the blade increases from Ω to ( Ω + w ) , while the axial component of the velocity remains constant.
The result is;  p′ =  1  2 ρ ( Ω + w) - Ω 2  r 2  2  = ρ ( Ω + w / 2 ) wr 2  (3.2.6)  Finally, combining this result (equation 3.2.6) with the previous equations 3.2.2 and 3.2.5, the drop of pressure in the wake becomes;  po - pw =  1 2 2 2 ρ ( uw - U ∞ ) + ρ ( Ω + w / 2 ) wwrw 2  (3.2.7)  The pressure gradient in the wake balances the centrifugal force on the fluid and is governed by the following equation;  dpw 2 = ρ ww rw drw  (3.2.8)  And then differentiating equation 3.2.7 relative to rw and equating to equation 3.2.8, a differential equation is obtained connecting the axial and rotational velocities in the wake,  1 d d 2 2 U ∞ - uw  = ( ww + Ω ) ( wwrw2 )   2 drw drw  (3.2.9)  The equation of axial momentum for the blade element, which can be established rigorously by a simple extension of the analysis of the previous section,  T = ∫ ρ uw (U ∞ - uw ) dAw + ∫ ( po - pw ) dAw  37  and in the differential form;  dT = ρ uw (U ∞ - uw ) dAw + ( po - pw ) dAw  (3.2.10)  also from the pressure decrease at the rotor plane, dT can alternatively be written as;  dT = p′dA By inserting equation 3.2.6 into its place in equation 3.2.11,  (3.2.11)  dT = ρ ( Ω + w / 2 ) wr 2 dA Finally, combining equation 3.2.1, 3.2.5, 3.2.10 and 3.2.12,  (3.2.12)   Ω + ww / 2 Ω + w / 2  1 2 2 - [U ∞ - uw ] =   uw ww rw 2 uw U∞    (3.2.13)  It should be emphasized that the equation of axial momentum is based on the assumption that the axial force due to the pressure on the lateral boundary of the streamline is equal to the pressure force, ( po Ao - pw Aw ) over its ends.
This assumption implies that the mutual interference between various annular elements has been neglected but the actual deviations from the conditions represented by equation 3.2.12 are believed to be extremely small in general.
The other assumptions made for deriving the general momentum equations so far are that the rotor was treated as having very large number of very narrow blades (infinite number of blades) resulting in negligible radial component of the velocity of the fluid and the air is incompressible and inviscid, i.e., fluid drag is zero [10].
Equations 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.9 and 3.2.13, though rather complex in form, suffice to determine the relationship between the thrust and torque of the blade and the flow in the slipstream.
If, for example, the angular velocity ww is known as a  38  function of the radius r in the wake, equation 3.2.9 determines the axial velocity,  uw and then equation 3.2.13, taken in conjunction with equation 3.2.1 and equation 3.2, determines the axial and rotational velocities at the rotor plane.
The thrust and torque of the rotor are then obtained from equation 3.2.12 and equation 3.2.3 respectively.
Owing to the complexity of these equations, however, it is customary to adopt certain approximations based on the fact that the rotational velocity in the slipstream is generally very small.
An exact solution of the general momentum equations can be obtained when the flow in the slipstream is irrotational except along the axis.
This condition implies that the rotational momentum wr 2 has the same value for all radial elements.
Then by virtue of equation 3.2.11, the axial velocity, uw is constant along a radius because this equation's right-hand side is zero.
Defining the axial velocities u and uw as  u = U ∞ (1 - a ) uw = U ∞ (1 - b ) After some algebraic manipulations, it can be obtained from equation 3.2.13,  b (1 - a ) b 2  a = 1 - 2  2  4λ (b - a )   (3.2.14)  Examination of equation 3.2.14 shows that the axial velocity reduction of the rotor disk is always approximately one-half the reduction in the far-wake for the tip-speed ratio above 2, which is the same result reached in the previous section when the wake rotation was neglected.
For the approximate solution, the following assumption is made.
The angular velocity w imparted to the slipstream is very small compared with the angular velocity Ω of the blades and it is therefore possible to simplify the general  39  equations by neglecting certain terms involving w2 [10].
On this basis of approximation the pressure pw in the wake is equal to the initial pressure po of the air and the decrease of pressure p′ across the rotor disk is equal to the decrease of total pressure head ( H o - H1 ) .
The relationships connecting the thrust and axial velocity are then the same as in the simple momentum theory, the axial velocity u at the rotor disk is the arithmetic mean of the axial velocity U ∞ and the slipstream velocity uw , and the element of thrust is  dT = 2 ρ u (u - U ∞ )dA 2 = 4πρU ∞ a (1 - a )rdr  (3.2.15)  Alternatively, from equation 3.2.6,  dT = p′dA = 2πρ (Ω + w / 2) wr 3dr And defining angular induction factor, a′ = w / 2Ω  dT = 4πρΩ 2 a′(1 + a′)r 3dr  (3.2.16)  Equating the two expressions for the thrust given in equation 3.2.15 and equation 3.2.16, a relationship is obtained between axial induction factor, a and angular induction factor a′ ,  a (1 - a ) Ω 2 r 2 = = λr2 2 a′(1 + a′) U ∞ The element of torque is obtained from equation 3.2.3 as following;  (3.2.17)  40  dQ = ρ uwr 2 dA = 4πρU ∞ Ω a′(1 - a )r 3dr (3.2.18)  The power generated at each radial element, dP is given by the following equation;  dP = Ω dQ  (3.2.19)  By substituting dQ from equation 3.2.18 into equation 3.2.19 and using the definition of local tip speed ratio, λr the expression for the power generated at each radial element becomes;  dP =  1  3  8 ρ AU ∞  2 a′(1 - a)λr3d λr  2 λ   (3.2.20)  The incremental contribution to the power coefficient from each annular ring is given by;  dC p =  dP 3 1/ 2 ρU ∞ A  (3.2.21)  By inserting equation 3.2.20 into equation 3.2.21 and integrating elemental power coefficient from local tip speed ratio at the hub, λh to the tip speed ratio, C p is obtained as;  Cp =  8  λ  2  ∫ a′(1 - a)λ d λ λ 3 r h  λ  r  (3.2.22)  In order to integrate equation 3.2.22, it is needed to relate the variables  a, a′ and λr .
By solving equation 3.2.17, a′ in terms of a ,  41  1 1 4 1 + 2 a (1 - a ) a′ = - + λr 2 2  (3.2.23)  The aerodynamic conditions for the maximum possible power production occur when the term a′(1 - a ) in equation 3.2.22 is at its greatest value.
Substituting the value for a′ from equation 3.2.23 into the term a′(1 - a ) and setting the derivative with respect to a and equating to zero yields;  (1 - a )(4a - 1) 2 λ = (1 - 3a ) 2 r  (3.2.24)  And substituting equation 3.2.24 into equation 3.2.17, it is found that for maximum power in each annular ring,  a′ = (1 - 3a ) /(4a - 1)  (3.2.25)  If equation 3.2.24 is differentiated with respect to a , a relationship between d λr and da at those conditions is obtained;  2λr d λr = 6(4a - 1)(1 - 2a ) 2 /(1 - 3a ) 2  da    (3.2.26)  Now, substituting the equations 3.2.24, 3.2.25 and 3.2.26 into the equation 3.2.22 gives;  C p ,max Where  24 2  (1 - a )(1 - 2a )(1 - 4a )  = 2 ∫  da (1 - 3a ) λ a1    a  2  (3.2.27)  a1 : corresponding axial induction factor for λr = λh a2 : corresponding axial induction factor for λr = λ  Also from equation 3.2.24;  42  λ 2 = (1 - a2 )(1 - 4a2 ) /(1 - 3a2 )  (3.2.28)  Equation 3.2.28 can be solved for the values of a that correspond to operation at tip speed ratios of interest.
Note also from equation 3.2.28, a2 = 1/ 3 is the upper limit of the axial induction factor giving an infinitely large tip speed ratio.

The wind may be considered to be a combination of the mean wind and turbulent fluctuations about that mean flow.
Experience has shown that the major aspects of wind turbine performance (mean power output and mean loads) are determined by the aerodynamic forces generated by the mean wind.
Periodic aerodynamic forces caused by wind shear, off-axis winds, rotor rotation, randomly fluctuating forces induced by turbulence and dynamic effects are the source of fatigue loads and are a factor in the peak loads experience by a wind turbine.
These are, of course, important, but can only be understood once the aerodynamics of steady state operation has been understood.
Accordingly this chapter focuses primarily on steady state aerodynamics.
The chapter starts with the analysis of an idealized wind turbine rotor.
The discussion introduces important concepts and illustrates the general behavior of wind turbine rotors and the airflow around wind turbine rotors.
The analysis is also used to determine theoretical performance limits for wind turbines.
General aerodynamic concepts are then introduced.
The details of momentum theory and blade-element theory are developed.
The combination of two theories, called strip theory or blade-element momentum theory (BEM) is then studied to outline the governing equations for the aerodynamic design and power prediction of a wind turbine rotor which will be used in the next chapter.
The last section of this chapter discusses the vortex theory.
Vortex theory is another approach for aerodynamic design of wind turbine rotors, but here only its  26  concepts related to the former two theories are explained in order to make some definitions in these theories more understandable.
1.2 THE ACTUATOR DISK THEORY AND THE BETZ LIMIT A simple model, generally attributed to Betz (1926) can be used to determine the power from an ideal turbine rotor, the thrust of the wind on the ideal rotor and the effect of the rotor operation on the local wind field.
The simplest aerodynamic model of a HAWT is known as 'actuator disk model' in which the rotor becomes a homogenous disk that removes energy from the wind.
Actuator disk theory is based on a linear momentum theory developed over 100 years ago to predict the performance of ship propeller.
The theory of the ideal actuator disk is based on the following assumptions[9]:  • Homogenous, Incompressible, steady state fluid flow • No frictional drag • The pressure increment or thrust per unit area is constant over the disk • The rotational component of the velocity in the slipstream is zero.
Thus the actuator disk is an ideal mechanism which imparts momentum to the fluid in the axial direction only  • There is continuity of velocity through the disk • An infinite number of blades A complete physical representation of this actuator disk may be obtained by considering a close pair of tandem propellers or turbine blades rotating in opposite direction and so designed that the element of torque at any radial distance from the axis has the same value for each blade in order that there shall be no rotational motion in the slipstream; also each turbine actual blade must be replaced with its small number of blades by another of the same diameter having a very large 27  number of very narrow equal frictionless blades, the solidity at any radius being the same as for the actual turbine and finally to have the blade angles suitably chosen to give a uniform distribution of thrust over the whole disk.
The analysis of the actuator disk theory assumes a control volume, in which the control volume boundaries are the surface of a stream tube and two crosssections of the stream tube as shown in Figure 3.1.  actuator disk p0  p0  pu  pd  U∞ Streamtube boundary 1  U2 U3  Uw wake  2  3  4  Figure 3.1 Idealized flow through a wind turbine represented by a non-rotating, actuator disk  The only flow is across the ends of the streamtube.
The turbine is represented by a uniform "actuator disk" which creates a discontinuity of pressure in the streamtube of air flowing through it.
Note also that this analysis is not limited to any particular type of wind turbine.
From the assumption that the continuity of velocity through the disk exists;  U 2 = U3 = U R For steady state flow, air mass flow rate through the disk can be written as;  28  m = ρ AU R  i  (3.1.1)  Applying the conservation of linear momentum to the control volume enclosing the whole system, the net force can be found on the contents of the control volume.
That force is equal and opposite to the thrust, T which is the force of the wind on the wind turbine.
Hence from the conservation of linear momentum for a one-dimensional, incompressible, time-invariant flow the thrust is equal and opposite to the change in momentum of air stream;  T = m (U ∞ - U w )  i  (3.1.2)  No work is done on either side of the turbine rotor.
Thus the Bernoulli function can be used in the two control volumes on either side of the actuator disk.
Between the free-stream and upwind side of the rotor (from section 1 to 2 in Figure 3.1) and between the downwind side of the rotor and far wake (from section 3 to 4 in Figure 3.1) respectively;  1 1 2 2 p0 + ρU ∞ = pu + ρU R 2 2 1 1 2 2 pd + ρU R = p0 + ρU w 2 2  (3.1.3) (3.1.4)  The thrust can also be expressed as the net sum forces on each side of the actuator disk;  T = Ap′ Where  (3.1.5)  p′ = ( pu - pd )  ( 3.1.6)  By using equations 3.1.3 and 3.1.4, the pressure decrease, p′ can be found as;  29  p′ =  1 2 2 ρ (U ∞ - U w ) 2  (3.1.7)  And by substituting equation 3.1.7 into equation 3.1.5;  T=  1 2 2 ρ A (U ∞ - U w ) 2 i  (3.1.8)  By equating the thrust values from equation 3.1.2 in which substituting equation 3.1.1 in place of m and equation 3.1.8, the velocity at the rotor plane can be found as;  UR =  U∞ + Uw 2  (3.1.9)  Thus, the wind velocity at the rotor plane, using this simple model, is the average of the upstream and downstream wind speeds.
If an axial induction factor (or the retardation factor), a is defined as the fractional decrease in the wind velocity between the free stream and the rotor plane, then  a=  U R = U ∞ (1 - a ) U w = U ∞ (1 - 2a )  U∞ - U R U∞  (3.1.10) (3.1.11) (3.1.12)  The velocity and pressure distribution are illustrated in Figure 3.2.
Because of continuity, the diameter of flow field must increase as its velocity decreases and note that there occurs sudden pressure drop at rotor plane which contributes the torque rotating turbine blades.
30  Figure 3.2 Velocity and pressure distribution along streamtube  The power output, P is equal to the thrust times the velocity at the rotor plane;  P = TU R Using equation 3.1.8,  P=  1 2 2 ρ A (U ∞ - U w )U R 2  And substituting for U R and U w from equations 3.1.11 and 3.1.12, 3 P = 2 ρ Aa (1 - a ) U ∞ 2  (3.1.12)  Using equation 2.5.1, the power coefficient C p becomes;  31  C p = 4a (1 - a )  2  (3.1.13)  The maximum C p is determined by taking the derivative of equation 3.1.13 with respect to a and setting it equal to zero yields;  (C p ) max = 16 / 27 = 0.5926 When a = 1/ 3 This result indicates that if an ideal rotor were designed and operated such that the wind speed at the rotor were 2/3 of the free stream wind speed, then it would be operating at the point of maximum power production.
This is known as the Betz limit.
From equations 3.1.8, 3.1.11 and 3.1.12 the axial thrust on the disk can be written in the following form; 2 T = 2 ρ Aa (1 - a ) )U ∞  (3.1.14)  Similarly to the power coefficient, thrust coefficient can be found as by use of equation 2.5.3;  CT = 4a(1 - a)  (3.1.15)  Note that CT has a maximum of 1.0 when a = 0.5 and the downstream velocity is zero.
At maximum power output (a = 1/ 3) , CT has a value of 8/9.
A graph of the  power and thrust coefficients for an ideal Betz turbine is illustrated in Figure 3.3.
Note that, as it can be seen in Figure 3.3, this idealized model is not valid for an axial induction factors greater than 0.5.
32  Figure 3.3 Operating parameters for a Betz turbine  In conclusion, the actuator disk theory provides a rational basis for illustrating that the flow velocity at the rotor is different from the free-stream velocity.
The Betz limit C p ,max = 0.593 shows the maximum theoretically possible rotor power coefficient that can be attained from a wind turbine.
In practice three effects lead to a decrease in the maximum achievable power coefficient;  • Rotation of wake behind the rotor • Finite number of blades and associated tip losses • Non-zero aerodynamic drag  3.3 THE GENERAL MOMENTUM THEORY The axial momentum theory of the previous section was developed on the assumption that there was no rotational motion in the slipstream and that the  33  turbine blades could be replaced by an actuator disk which produced a sudden decrease of pressure in the fluid without any change of velocity.
More generally, the slipstream will have a rotational motion by the reaction of the torque of the blade and this rotational motion implies a further loss of energy.
To extend the theory to include the effects of this rotational motion, it is necessary to modify the qualities of the actuator disk by assuming that it can also impart a rotational component to the fluid velocity while the axial and radial components remain unchanged.
Using a streamtube analysis, equations can be written that express the relation between the wake velocities (both axial and rotational) and the corresponding wind velocities at the rotor disk.
In Figure 3.4 an annular streamtube model of this flow illustrating the rotation of the wake is shown for making the visualization clear.
And Figure 3.5 illustrates the geometry of this streamtube model of wind flow through a HAWT.
Rotor plane  Figure 3.4 Streamtube model of flow behind rotating wind turbine blade  34  Rotor plane  v p0  vw u uw rw pw  v  U∞ free-stream  r u pu pd  w  dr  streamlines  wake  Figure 3.5 Geometry of the streamtube model of flow through a HAWT rotor      56  The disturbance of the flow caused by a rotor can be represented as the induced velocity of the completed vortex system, comprising the bound vortices of the propeller blades and the free vortex sheets of the slipstream and the motion of the fluid relative to the propeller is the resultant of the axial velocity and its induced velocity.
Owing to the difficulty of calculating the induced velocity of the system of helical vortex sheets which constitute the slipstream of a rotor, the induced velocity is usually calculated on the assumption that the propeller has a very large number of blades.
This assumption implies that the vorticity of the slipstream is distributed throughout the whole of the fluid instead of being concentrated on a few vortex sheets and the vorticity can then be assumed to be grouped in the following manner.
Considering first the condition of constant circulation along the blades, the boundary of the slipstream is a cylindrical vortex sheet as shown in Figure 3.11.
Figure 3.11 Helical vortices replaced by axial and circumferential vortex lines  In place of the helical vortex lines covering the surface, the vorticity of the sheet may be considered a close succession of vortex rings RR whose vorticity represents the decreased axial velocity of the slipstream and a surface of vortex  57  lines LL whose vorticity represents the rotation of the slipstream.
The vortex system is completed by the axial vortex AA.
More generally, with circulation varying along the blades of the propeller, the whole slipstream must be considered as full of vortex systems of this simpler type.
The induced velocity of the vortex system in the ultimate wake far behind the rotor plane will be an axial velocity (U ∞ - uw ) and an angular velocity ww , which will be function of the radial coordinate rw .
In this wake the induced velocity of the bound vortices of the blades is negligibly small.
At the disc also the bound vortices can not give any component to the axial velocity owing to the symmetrical distribution of this vorticity relative to any arbitrary point of the disc and hence the axial induced velocity (u - U ∞ ) will be due wholly to the trailing vortex system.
Also if the expansion of the slipstream can be ignored in calculating these induced velocities, it can easily be seen that the axial induced velocity at the rotor disk is half that in the ultimate wake; for the vortex system is then simply a long cylinder extending indefinitely in one direction from the rotor disk and the induced axial velocity at a point of the wake, where the cylinder extends indefinitely in both directions, must clearly be double that at the corresponding point of the rotor disk.
Thus  1 (U ∞ - u ) = (U ∞ - uw ) 2 Or  1 u = (U ∞ + uw ) 2  (3.1.8)  which is the well known equation of the momentum theory described in section 3.1 from which the axial induction factor has been defined.
58  The induced angular velocity w immediately behind the rotor disk can be related to the corresponding angular velocity ww in the wake by considering the constancy of circulation of the fluid.
The ring of fluid of radius r immediately behind the rotor disk has the circulation 2π wr 2 and by the laws of hydrodynamics this circulation must remain constant as the ring of fluid passes down stream.
In the wake the radius of the ring has expanded to rw and there must therefore be a decrease of the angular velocity governed by the equation as described in section 3.2; 2 wr 2 = ww rw  (3.2.2)  Immediately in front of the rotor disk there can be no such circulation, since the fluid approaching the rotor is in irrotational motion.
Also the bound vorticitiy of the rotor blades must cause equal and opposite induced angular velocities ± w′ immediately before and behind the rotor disk and hence the induced angular velocity of the trailing vortex system must have the value w′ at the rotor disk in order to cancel the effect of the bound vortices in front of the disk.
It follows that the total induced angular velocity immediately behind the rotor disk is 2 w′ and this is the angular velocity previously denoted by w .
Hence the induced angular velocity of the trailing vortices at the propeller disk is  1 w and the angular 2  induction factor in section 3.2 has been defined by taking this value as a basis.
Vortex theory shows also the independence of blade elements which has been assumed in blade element theory in section 3.3 and tried to explained physically.
Here it will be explained with the help of vortex theory as well by taking the consideration of the system of trailing vortices which leads to the conclusion that induced flow experienced by the blade elements at radial distance r from the axis depends solely on the forces experienced by these elements and is not influenced by the blade elements at greater or less radial distance.
Consider the action of the  59  blade elements dr at radial distance r when the remainder of each rotor blade is inoperative.
The trailing vortices which spring from the ends of the element lie on the surfaces of two circular cylinders of radius r and r + dr respectively and the  vorticity may be resolved into two components as described before; one having its axis parallel to the rotor axis and the other being circumferential and similar to a succession of vortex rings.
The first component of the vorticity acts as the roller bearings between the rotating shell of air bounded by the cylindrical surfaces and the general mass of air.
Now the general mass of air can not acquire any circulation about the axis and hence the rotation due to the torque of the blade elements is confined to the region between the two cylindrical surfaces.
Hence also the rotational interference due to the vortex system is experienced by those blade elements which gave rise to the vorticity.
A similar argument can be applied to the second component of the vorticity and thus the independence of the blade elements at different radial distances from the axis of the rotor is established [14].
It may be summarized the results of the vortex theory as follows:  • The induced flow at any radius r depends only on the thrust and torque grading at this radius.
In other words, the blade elements at differing radii are hydrodynamically independent.
This proves the validity of the assumption about this result mentioned in blade element theory in section 3.3  • The induced axial velocity at a blade element is just half the axial velocity in the distant part of the slipstream which comes from the element at that radius.
This is in agreement with the findings of the actuator disk theory of section 3.1  • The induced circumferential or rotational velocity of inflow at a blade element is just the half the rotational velocity in the distant part of the slipstream which comes from the elements at that radius which is what was done while defining angular induction factor in the general momentum theory in section 3.2.
60  Before closing this section a few words about the advantages and disadvantages of the vortex theory over the BEM theory are the following; the BEM theory offers the method of ease of understanding and use as well as minimal computation requirements.
However there are a number of situations where it is not reasonable to expect BEM methods over the vortex methods since vortex methods offer the greatest accuracy.
Though methods are available for incorporating some complex effects such as yawed flow and unsteady aerodynamics into a BEM analysis, it is much more desirable to seek analytical methods of vortex theory which are fundamentally better suited to complex flows.
The greatest obstacle to widespread use of vortex methods is the computation burden.
No programs are currently available that calculate the details of an unsteady, three-dimensional, free wake in a reasonable time, regardless of computer platform [7].
61  CHAPTER 4 HAWT BLADE DESIGN 1.2 INTRODUCTION In this chapter, the application of BEM theory on the HAWT blade design and analyzing the aerodynamic performance of a rotor will be explained.
BEM theory, as previously developed, does not account the effect of blade numbers of a rotor.
In other words, the equations of BEM theory were derived assuming infinite number of blades of a rotor.
This chapter begins with introducing the concept of tip-loss factor and the generally recommended expression for including tip losses in HAWT blade design is given.
The governing equations developed in BEM theory will then be modified in order to take the tip losses into account.
In the next section flow states in which HAWTs are operating will be examined.
At which values of axial induction factor the application of BEM theory becomes invalid will be explained and the Glauert empirical relationship will then be given in order to proceed the blade design for those values of axial induction factor.
Since the HAWT blades are made from airfoils to transform the kinetic energy in the wind into useful energy, subsequent section is left to the introduction of airfoil selection criteria in HAWT blade design.
Most used airfoil families are described as well.
After giving all these necessary knowledge for a blade design, the blade design procedure for an optimum rotor and power performance prediction procedure for the modified blade shape are given.
The output of the BLADESIGN program performed for the airfoil NACA 4412 are also put in this section as an example.
62  The chapter is ended with the results and explanatory figures showing the effect of some parameters relating to the blade design.
It should be noted here that various methods [15,16,17,18,19] for HAWT blade design and predicting performance of a rotor have been studied and the important concepts [20,21] for design procedure have been used while developing the user-interface computer program, BLADESIGN.
1.2 THE TIP-LOSS FACTOR There was an assumption; the rotor has an infinite number of blades which was used in all theories discussed in the previous chapter.
With the aid of this assumption radial velocity of the flow across the rotor plane and in the wake has been always neglected and by so the derivations of governing equations have been established.
But near the boundary of the slipstream the air tends to flow around the edges of the blade tips and acquires an important radial velocity.
Because the pressure on the suction side of a blade is lower than on the pressure side which causes the air to flow around the tip from the lower to upper surface, reducing lift and hence power production near the tip.
A number of methods have been suggested for including the effect of tip losses.
An approximate method of estimating the effect of this radial flow and hence including the effect of tip losses has been given by L.Prandtl.
Prandtl tip loss model is generally recommended for the following reasons;  • Prandtl model prediction are in qualitative agreement with the behavior of HAWT rotors,  • Calculations of rotor power and thrust made with Prandtl model are in good agreement with test data,  • BEM theory calculations made with Prandtl model show good agreement with calculations made with vortex theory,  63  • The Prandtl model is easier to program and use The expression obtained by Prandtl for tip-loss factor is given by the following equation [22];    - ( B / 2 ) 1 - ( r R )       F = ( 2 π ) cos -1 exp   ( r R ) sin ϕ         (4.2.1)  The application of this equation for the losses at the blade tips is to provide an approximate correction to the system of equations summarized in section 3.4.2 for predicting rotor performance and blade design.
The physical fact represented by the tip correction is virtually that the maximum decrease of axial velocity (U ∞ - uw ) or 2aU ∞ in the slipstream occurs only on the vortex sheets and that the average decrease of axial velocity in the slipstream is only a fraction F of this velocity.
Thus, to order of approximation of the analysis the correct form of the axial momentum equation (equation 3.2.15) will be taken to be [2]; 2 dT = 4 FπρU ∞ a(1 - a)rdr  (4.2.2)  Similarly, also the angular momentum equation (equation 3.2.18) will be assumed to be [2];  dQ = 4 FπρU ∞ Ω a′(1 - a )r 3dr  (4.2.3)  Thus the effect of the tip-loss is to reduce slightly the thrust and torque contributed by the elements near the tips of the blades.
Equations derived in section 3.3 are all based on the definition of the forces used in blade element theory and remain unchanged.
When the forces from the  64  general momentum theory are set equal using the method of BEM theory as performed before, the derivation of the flow condition is changed.
Carrying the tip-loss factor through the calculations, the changes (through equations 3.4.4 to 3.4.9 and 3.4.14) will be as following;  a cos ϕ = (σ CL ) (1 - a) 4 F sin 2 ϕ a′ (σ CL ) = (1 - a) 4λr F sin ϕ a′ (σ CL ) = (1 + a′) 4 F cos ϕ 4 F sin ϕ (cos ϕ - λr sin ϕ ) σ (sin ϕ + λr cos ϕ ) 1  1 + [4 F sin ϕ (σ CL )cos ϕ ]  2  (4.2.4)  (4.2.5)  (4.2.6)  CL =  (4.2.7)  a=  (4.2.8)  a′ =  1 [[4 F cosϕ (σ Cl )] - 1]  (4.2.9)  Cp =  ∫ λ 2 λ λr2 d λr h  8  λ  F sin 2 ϕ ( cos ϕ - λr sin ϕ )( sin ϕ + λr cos ϕ ) 1 - ( CD CL ) cot ϕ  ...   (4.2.10)  65  Even though the tip-loss factor has been accounted for the development of the computer program of the blade design and power performance prediction in this thesis, for the purpose of simplifying the calculations without including the tip-loss factor, an effective-radius of the rotor may be defined for the diminished thrust and torque output of the tip regions.
This effective radius is generally taken as about 3% smaller than the tip radius.
Note that from equation 4.2.1 it can be seen that F is always between 0 and 1 and in this empirical approach the following definition can be set;  F =1 F =0  if if  0 < r < re re ≤ r ≤ R  re ≈ 0.97 R 4.3 HAWT FLOW STATES Measured wind turbine performance closely approximates the results of BEM theory at low values of the axial induction factors but general momentum theory is no longer valid at axial induction factors greater that 0.5, because according to the equation 3.1.10, the wind velocity in the far wake would be negative.
In practice, as the axial induction factor increases above 0.5, the flow patterns through the wind turbine become much more complex than those predicted by the general momentum theory.
The thrust coefficient represented by the equation 3.1.14 can be used to characterize the different flow states of a rotor.
Figure 4.1 shows flow states and thrust force vectors T associated with a wide range of axial induction factors.
According to this figure, for negative induction factors ( a < 0 ) it is simple to continue the analysis to show that the device will act as a propulsor producing an upwind force (i.e.
CT < 0 ) that adds energy to the wake.
This is typical of the propeller state.
The operating states relevant to HAWTs are designated by the windmill state and the turbulent wake state.
The windmill state is the normal  66  operating state.
The windmill state is characterized by the flow conditions described by general momentum theory for axial induction factors less than about 0.5.
As illustrated by the data in Figure 4.1 obtained on wind turbines, above a =0.5,  rotor thrust increases up to 2 with increasing induction factor in the  turbulent wake state, instead of decreasing as predicted by the equation 3.1.14.
While general momentum theory no longer describes the turbine behavior, Glauert's empirical formula for axial induction factor from 0.4 to 1.0 are often used in HAWT rotor design for predicting wind turbine flow states.
C =4a(1-a) T  Windmill state  Turbulent Wake state  Figure 4.1 Relationship between the axial induction factor, flow state and thrust of a rotor[1]  67  When the induction somewhat over unity, the flow regime is called the vortex ring state and when a >2.0 the rotor reverses the direction of flow which is termed propeller brake state with power being added to flow to create downwind thrust on the rotor.
In the turbulent wake state, as stated before, a solution can be found by using the Glauert empirical relationship between the axial induction factor, a and the thrust coefficient, CT in conjunction with the blade element theory.
The empirical relationship developed by Glauert, including tip losses is [2];  a = (1 F ) 0.143 + 0.0203 - 0.6427 ( 0.889 - CT )    This equation is valid for a > 0.4 or equivalently for CT > 0.96  (4.3.1)  The Glauert empirical relationship was determined for the overall thrust coefficient for a rotor.
It is customary, however, to assume that it applies equally to equivalently local thrust coefficients for each blade section.
The local thrust coefficient CTr can be defined for each annular rotor section as;  CTr =  dT 2 1/ 2 ρU ∞ 2π rdr  (4.3.2)  From the equation 3.3.13 for the elemental thrust force from blade element theory, the local thrust coefficient becomes;  CTr = σ (1 - a ) ( CL cos ϕ + CD sin ϕ ) sin 2 ϕ 2  (4.3.3)  In order to include the blade design and power performance prediction of highly loaded HAWTs which are operating at high tip-speed ratios, the Glauert empirical formula is used in the developing of the computer program.
It firstly  68  calculates the local thrust coefficient for each blade section according to the equation 4.3.3 and if CTr < 0.96 then uses the previously derived equations for the  blade design.
If CTr > 0.96 then it estimates axial induction factor using equation 4.3.1 and this new value of axial induction factor is used in the equations for the design.
4.4 AIRFOIL SELECTION IN HAWT BLADE DESIGN HAWT blades use airfoils to develop mechanical power.
The cross-sections of HAWT blades have the shape of airfoils.
The width and length of the blade are functions of the desired aerodynamic performance, the maximum desired rotor power, the assumed airfoil parameters and strength calculations.
Hence designing HAWT blade depends on knowledge of the properties of airfoils.
The most significant flow factor influencing the behavior of airfoils is that of viscosity which is characterized by the Reynolds number of the airfoil/fluid combination.
The Reynolds number Re is defined by:  Re =  U rel c  υ  (4.4.1)  Airfoils in use on modern wind turbines range in representative chord size from about 0.3 m on a small-scale turbine over 2 m on a megawatt-scale rotor.
Tip speeds typically range from approximately 45 to 90 m/s.
Then for HAWT airfoils Reynolds number range from about 0.5 million to 10 million.
This implies that turbine airfoils generally operate beyond sensitive.
It should be noted that there are significant differences in airfoil behavior at different Reynolds numbers.
For that reason it must be made sure that appropriate Reynolds number data are available for the blade design.
69  The lift and drag characteristics of airfoils show also significant aspect-ratio dependence at angles of attack larger than 30 deg.
But in the fully-attached region in which HAWT is operating under windmill state are not greatly affected by aspect-ratio, so that two-dimensional (i.e.
infinite aspect-ratio) data can be used in blade design at low angles of attack.
However, when two-dimensional data are used, tip-loss factor must be added as described in equation 4.2.1.
In this thesis what has been considered in constructing the airfoil database from the computer program XFOIL which will be mentioned in the next chapter includes these considerations; two-dimensional data with Reynolds number in the order of 1 million.
There are evidently many engineering requirements into the selection of a wind turbine airfoil.
These include primary requirements related to aerodynamic performance, maintainability.
The usual assumption is that high lift and low drag are desirable for an airfoil and that the drag-to-lift ratio γ which is known as glide ratio as given below is a critical consideration [23]; structural, strength and stiffness, manufacturability and  γ = CD / CL  (4.4.2)  Airfoils for HAWTs are often designed to be used at low angles of attack, where lift coefficients are fairly high and drag coefficients are fairly low(i.e.
fairly low glide ratio).
Many different standard airfoils developed for aircraft have been used on HAWTs.
The NACA 230XX series and NACA44XX series airfoils have been used on many modern HAWT units.
The NACA 63-2XX series airfoils have demonstrated the best overall performance characteristics of the NACA airfoil families.
70  The experienced gained from these traditional airfoils has highlighted the shortcomings of such airfoils for HAWT application.
Consequently, a new airfoil family has been developed.
The name SERI designates the classification of these airfoils of this family which is now being used on commercial HAWTs.
In this thesis, SERI S809 airfoil characteristics has also been obtained and included in the airfoil database of the BLADESIGN program as an example apart from the NACA44XX, NACA 230XX and NACA 63-2XX series.
4.6 MODIFICATION OF BLADE GEOMETRY In general a rotor is not of the optimum shape because of highly loaded of the designed blade which can be produced from this optimum shape.
Furthermore, when a designed blade is run at a different tip-speed ratio other than the one for which it is designed, it is no longer optimum.
Thus, blade shape is generally redesigned for he purpose of decreasing the thrust force and torque acting on the blade during its operation by trying to keep the design power coefficient close to the one which is obtained for the designed blade.
In the previous section the method of obtaining optimum blade shape has been introduced and the variation of designed blade geometry parameters (chordlength and twist) for the airfoil NACA 4412 has been illustrated with figures as an example.
In this section by using the designed blade geometry as a guide, modification of blade geometry that promises to be a good approximation will be explained and to illustrate, the modified blade shape will be compared with the designed one for the airfoil NACA 4412.
4.6.1 MODIFICATION OF CHORD-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION:  The chord-length variation of a designed blade shape is not linear and near the root the blade chord-length is increasing steeply as it is shown in Figure 4.5.
Here such type of designed blade shape will be modified such that its shape becomes linear tapered.
While transforming the designed blade shape to a linear taper shape, the area of the designed blade shape is used as necessary information, in other words the chord-length of each blade element for the both shape should remain the same.
At least the one of linear taper shapes whose blade elements' chord-lengths are the closest to the designed blade elements' chord-lengths should be selected.
Also it should be kept in mind that most power is generated by the outer part of the blade (between r / R = 0.5 and r / R = 0.9 ) [24].
For this reason a blade linearized through these points of the ideal blade shape seems to be a good choice.
80  Generally, an iterative approach is used.
That is, a blade shape can be assumed and predicted its performance and another blade shape is assumed and the prediction of performance is repeated until a suitable blade shape has been chosen.
In Figure 4.8 the trapezoidal transformation of the designed blade shape for the NACA 4412 is shown.
Figure 4.8 Modified blade chord-length variations along the non-dimensional blade radius  4.6.2 MODIFICATION OF TWIST DISTRIBUTION: When the twist  distribution of a designed blade shape is analyzed from the Figure 4.6, it can be seen that a designed blade has to be twisted strongly, especially near the root again as it occurs in the chord-length variation of the same blade.
For that reason twist distribution can also be modified considering the ease of fabrication.
In this thesis, this modification has been performed such that twist distribution of the designed blade has been linearized by using the least-square method [25].
Also at some distance from blade root the twist becomes negative which generally causes the blade elements from this distance to blade tip to be stalled.
To prevent these blade  81  elements from being in stall region, their twist values are set to zero as shown in Figure 4.9.
Figure 4.9 Modified twist distribution along the non-dimensional blade radius  4.7 POWER PREDICTION OF MODIFIED BLADE SHAPE Now that the known parameters are chord-length and twist distribution along the blade length, the analysis is just reverse of the one which was done for designing optimum blade shape in section 4.5.
In the previous case design angle of attack, design lift coefficient and glide ratio corresponding to design lift coefficient were chosen and by so the parameters of blade geometry was found for an optimum rotor.
In this case lift coefficient and angle of attack have to be determined from the known blade geometry parameters.
This requires an iterative solution in which for each blade element the axial and angular induction factors are firstly taken as the values which were found for the corresponding designed blade elements and then determined within an acceptable tolerance of the previous guesses of induction factors during iteration.
The computer program written for this iteration procedure calculates the induction factors according to the flow chart given in Figure 4.10.

Tip-loss factor and drag effect have also been considered in these equations.
The method of determining blade shape for optimum performance of a turbine has been developed, how an optimum blade shape is modified for the best performance has been introduced and finally power performance calculation methods for both have been established.
And the airfoil NACA 4412 was used while performing these methods and illustrated with figures as an example.
In addition to these studies, the effect of some parameters relating to the blade design have also been investigated for the purpose of keeping in mind what should be considered while designing a blade shape for the best performance and the results are given with figures following this section.
Figure 4.11 shows the maximum achievable power coefficients for a HAWT with 1, 2 and 3 blades and no drag.
The performance for ideal conditions (infinite number of blades) is also shown.
It can be seen that the fewer the blades the lower the possible CP at the same tip-speed ratio.
For that reason most wind turbines use two or three blades and in general most two-bladed wind turbines use a higher tipspeed ratio than most three-bladed wind turbines.
Thus, there is little practical difference in the maximum achievable CP value between typical two- and threebladed designs, assuming no drag.
Moreover, the effect of the number of blades is negligible at high design tip-speed ratios.
The effect of glide ratio on maximum achievable power coefficients for a three-bladed rotor is shown in Figure 4.12.
There is clearly a significant reduction in maximum achievable power as the airfoil drag increases.
It can be seen that it clearly benefits the blade designer to use or design airfoils with low glide ratio.
4.5 BLADE DESIGN PROCEDURE Designing a blade shape from a known airfoil type for an optimum rotor means determining the blade shape parameters; chord length distribution and twist distribution along the blade length for a certain tip-speed ratio at which the power coefficient of the rotor is maximum.
Therefore first of all the change of the power coefficient of the rotor with respect to tip-speed ratio should be figured out in order to determine the design tip-speed ratio, λd corresponding to which the rotor has a maximum power coefficient.
The blade design parameters will then be according to this design tip-speed ratio.
As it can be seen from the equation 4.2.10, the overall power coefficient, C p depends on the relative wind angle ( ϕ ), local tip-speed ratio ( λr ), the glide ratio ( CD / CL ) and the tip loss factor ( F ).
To get maximum C p value from this equation is only possible to make the elemental power coefficient maximum for each blade element.
In other words, the term in the integral of the mentioned equation should be maximum for each blade element in order to get maximum overall power coefficient from the summation of each.
Since the airfoil type is selected before, the glide ratio included in this term can be chosen so as to it gets maximum value.
This can be found from the twodimensional polar diagram of that airfoil.
So the other variables left in the term are the relative wind angle and local tip-speed ratio because the variable, tip-loss factor  71  depends also on these two variables for an assumed blade number as it can be seen from the equation 4.2.1.
Hence a relationship can be established between the relative wind angle and local tip-speed ratio to determine the optimum relative wind angle, ϕopt for a certain local tip-speed ratio.
The condition is given below;  ϕopt   F sin 2 ϕ ( cos ϕ - λr sin ϕ )( sin ϕ + λr cos ϕ ) ...   → MAX    1 - ( CD CL ) cot ϕ        A computer program on MATLAB was written to determine the maximum power coefficient for each blade element (elemental power coefficient) for any set of values of local tip-speed ratio.
The result is given graphically in Figure 4.2 for an airfoil having glide ratio 0.036  Figure 4.2 Variation of elemental power coefficient with relative wind angles for different values of local tip-speed ratio.
72  These set of results in Figure 4.2 gives a unique relationship between relative wind angle and local tip-speed ratio when the maximum elemental power coefficient is considered.
When the optimum relative wind angle values are plotted with respect to the corresponding local tip-speed ratio values at which the elemental power coefficient is maximum for a wide range of glide ratios, the relationship as shown in Figure 4.3 can be found to be nearly independent of glide ratio and tip-loss factor.
Figure 4.3 Variation of optimum relative wind angle with respect to local tip-speed ratio at optimum elemental power coefficient for B = 3  Hence the condition given before can be rearranged as following;  ϕopt ≈ MAX {sin 2 ϕ ( cos ϕ - λr sin ϕ )( sin ϕ + λr cos ϕ )}  73  Therefore a general relationship can be found between optimum relative wind angle and local tip-speed ratio which will be applicable for any airfoil type by taking the partial derivative of the term above, i.e.
;  ∂ {sin 2 ϕ ( cosϕ - λr sin ϕ )( sin ϕ + λr cosϕ )} = 0 ∂ϕ Equation 4.5.1 reveals after some algebra [2];  (4.5.1)  ϕopt = ( 2 3) tan -1 (1 λr )  (4.5.2)  In Figure 4.4 the plot of equation 4.5.2 is shown together with the others shown in Figure 4.3.
As it can be seen from Figure 4.4 below, the relationship between ϕopt and λr specified by the equation 4.5.2 can be readily used instead of establishing different relationships for each airfoil type.
Figure 4.4 Comparison of equation 4.5.2 with the data found for different glide ratios  74  Having found the solution of determining the optimum relative wind angle for a certain local tip-speed ratio, the rest is nothing but to apply the equations from equation 4.2.7 to 4.2.10, which were derived from the blade-element momentum theory and modified including the tip loss factor, to define the blade shape and to find out the maximum power coefficient for a selected airfoil type.
The procedure of blade design begins with dividing the blade length into N elements.
The local tip-speed ratio for each blade element can then be calculated with the use of equation 2.5.2 and 3.2.17 as given below;  λr ,i = λ ( ri R )  (4.5.3)  Then according to equation 4.5.2 the optimum relative wind angle for each blade element is determined;  ϕopt ,i = ( 2 3) tan -1 (1 λr ,i ) From the equation 4.2.1 the tip loss factor for each blade element is found;  (4.5.4)    - ( B / 2 ) 1 - ( ri R )       Fi = ( 2 π ) cos -1 exp   ( ri R ) sin ϕopt ,i         (4.5.5)  The chord-length distribution can then be calculated for each blade element by using equation 4.2.7;  ci =  8π ri Fi sin ϕopt ,i (cos ϕopt ,i - λr ,i sin ϕopt ,i )  BCL ,design  (sin ϕopt ,i + λr ,i cos ϕopt ,i )  (4.5.6)  where CL ,design is chosen such that the glide ratio is minimum at each blade element.
75  The twist distribution can be determined from the following equation which can be easily derived from the velocity diagram shown in Figure 3.8;  θi = ϕopt ,i - α design  (4.5.7)  Where α design is again the design angle of attack at which CL ,design is obtained.
Finally, the power coefficient is determined using a sum approximating the integral in equation 4.2.10;   8∆λr   2  2  Fi sin ϕopt ,i ( cos ϕopt ,i - λr ,i sin ϕopt ,i )...   C p = ∑  λ   i =1 ( sin ϕopt ,i + λr ,i cos ϕopt ,i ) 1 - ( CD CL ) cot ϕopt ,i  λr2,i      N  (4.5.8)  As a result, for a selected airfoil type and for a specified tip-speed ratio and blade length (i.e.
rotor radius), the blade shape can be designed for optimum rotor and from the calculation of power coefficient the maximum power that can be extracted from the wind can then be found for any average wind velocity.
As an example, the blade chord-length and twist distribution for an optimum three-bladed rotor at the design tip-speed ratio λd = 10 is tabulated in Table 4.1 for the airfoil NACA 4412 whose lift coefficient and drag coefficient values are taken at Re = 1x106 .
76  In Figure 4.5 chord-length distribution with respect to radial location of each blade element both of which are normalized with blade radius is shown.
Figure 4.5 Chord-length distribution for the designed blade  Similarly twist distribution with respect to radial location is illustrated in Figure 4.6.
Finally the power coefficient variation with respect to tip-speed ratio is given graphically in Figure 4.7.
From this figure it can be seen that the design tip-speed ratio should be taken to as 10 where the power coefficient is at maximum value for the designed blade design.

Therefore, in this study, the blade geometry was simplified and performance of modified blade was examined.
At first, the strongly non-linear taper was replaced with a linear taper.
Among the modified blades whose surfaces are equal to the designed blade's ones, the one which has the highest power output was chosen.
Then the large blade twist was replaced with a linear blade setting angle distribution.
Under these conditions, it was seen that the new modified blade reduced power output approximately 10% of the power output of the designed blade.
This means that in order to extract the same amount of power with the designed blade, the blade span must be expanded approximately 5%.
Finally, all the studies on HAWT blade design were presented on a userinterface computer program written on MATLAB.
User of the blade design program gives the required power output, number of blades, blade profile and design wind velocity as input and the program gives design power coefficient, design tip-speed ratio and rotor diameter as output for both designed and modified blade.
In addition to that, blade geometries were listed for again both designed and modified blade.
The graphical illustration of figures for the comparison of designed and modified blade and three dimensional views of both blades were what the program does lastly.
The studies of this thesis can be surely used for further works.
These further works might be either directly parallel to the topic of this thesis to add valuable usefulness on horizontal-axis wind turbine blade design or related to the studies of this thesis to extend the studies on horizontal-axis wind turbines as they are described in the following paragraphs.
If it is recalled that the modification of a designed blade was carried out for linear taper of chord-length distribution and linear variation of setting angle distribution using least square method, other alternative methods for modification  120  may also be tried and their performance may be compared with their designed blades and with the ones obtained in this study.
In this study, the other constrain is the use of the known airfoil types.
Apart from these, new airfoil designs may be made by the use of XFOIL program and a method of designing new airfoil shapes which show reasonably high performance may be proposed.
The lift and drag behaviors of airfoils are measured in wind tunnels under nonrotating conditions.
Investigations have shown that the same airfoils, when used on a horizontal-axis wind turbine, may exhibit delayed stall and may produce more power than expected.
So the rotor performance prediction considering the delayed stall of airfoils in the operation of HAWTs may be studied.
Besides, blade element-momentum (BEM) theory approach has been used to design HAWT blades.
There are other approaches to predicting blade performance and to designing blades that may be more applicable in some situations.
Vortex wake method, for example, might be used and results of this method can be compared with the results of BLADESIGN.
Structural design of HAWT blades is as important as their aerodynamic design.
The dynamic structural loads which a rotor will experience play the major role in determining the lifetime of the rotor.
Obviously, aerodynamic loads are a major source of loading and must be well understood before the structural response can be accurately determined and also the blade geometry parameters are required for dynamic load analysis of wind turbine rotors.
So such a study on the dynamic load analysis of HAWT blades might also use the outputs of BLADESIGN.

The program is well established and can be readily used for the purpose of designing horizontal-axis wind turbine blades.
It takes power required from a wind turbine rotor, number of blades to be used on the rotor, the average wind speed, an airfoil type which can be selected from the airfoil database in the program as input and gives the following as output; blade geometry parameters (twist and chord-length) for both the designed blade and modified blade considering the ease of fabrication and the approximate rotor diameter to be constructed for the specified power.
The program shows the results with figures for making the design decision more clear.
It also gives the three dimensional views and solid models of the designed and modified blades for visualization.
The scope of the thesis is restricted to horizontal-axis wind turbines within two general configurations of wind turbines; namely horizontal-axis and vertical-axis wind turbines.
The following sections of this chapter, however, gives an introductory remarks about wind turbine; its origin, development in history, some innovative types of wind turbines, the exploration of major advantages of horizontal-axis wind turbines over all other wind turbines, technological development and use of horizontal-axis wind turbines around the world.

Prof. Dr. Tahsin ÇETİNKAYA January 2005, 124 Pages,  Designing horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) blades to achieve satisfactory levels of performance starts with knowledge of the aerodynamic forces acting on the blades.
In this thesis, HAWT blade design is studied from the aspect of aerodynamic view and the basic principles of the aerodynamic behaviors of HAWTs are investigated.
Blade-element momentum theory (BEM) known as also strip theory, which is the current mainstay of aerodynamic design and analysis of HAWT blades, is used for HAWT blade design in this thesis.
Firstly, blade design procedure for an optimum rotor according to BEM theory is performed.
Then designed blade shape is modified such that modified blade will be lightly loaded regarding the highly loaded of the designed blade and power prediction of modified blade is analyzed.
When the designed blade shape is modified, it is seen that the power extracted from the wind is reduced about 10%  iv  and the length of modified blade is increased about 5% for the same required power.
BLADESIGN which is a user-interface computer program for HAWT blade design is written.
It gives blade geometry parameters (chord-length and twist distributions) and design conditions (design tip-speed ratio, design power coefficient and rotor diameter) for the following inputs; power required from a turbine, number of blades, design wind velocity and blade profile type (airfoil type).
The program can be used by anyone who may not be intimately concerned with the concepts of blade design procedure and the results taken from the program can be used for further studies.

Prof. Dr. Tahsin ÇETİNKAYA Ocak 2005, 124 Sayfa,  Yatay eksenli rüzgar türbin palalarının tasarımı, öncelikle palalara etkiyen aerodinamik kuvvetlerin bilinmesini gerektirir.
Bu çalışmada, yatay eksenli rüzgar türbin palalarının tasarımı konusu, akışkanlar dinamiği yönünden ele alınmış ve yatay eksenli rüzgar türbinlerinin aerodinamiği ile ilgili temek teoriler incelenmiştir.
Bu çalışmada, yatay eksenli rüzgar türbin palalarının tasarımı için, günümüz rüzgar türbin palalarının tasarımında en sık rastlanan yöntem olan pala elemanı teorisinden faydalanılmıştır.
İlk olarak optimum rotora ait bir palanın tasarımı için gerekli metot oluşturulmuştur.
Daha sonra tasarımı yapılan palaya etkiyen kuvvetlerin büyük olması dikkate alınarak, palanın geometrisi; palaya etkiyen kuvvetler azaltılacak şekilde düzeltilmiş ve geometrisi düzeltilen yeni palaların performansı incelenmiştir.
Bu incelemede, geometrisi düzeltilen palaların performansı;  vi  optimum rotor için tasarlanmış palanın performansına oranla yaklaşık %10 azaldığı görülmüştür.
Ayrıca istenilen belirli bir türbin gücü için, geometrisi düzeltilmiş palanın boyunun, optimum rotor için tasarımı yapılan palanın boyuna oranla yaklaşık %5 daha uzun olması gerektiği görülmüştür.
Yatay eksenli rüzgar türbin palalarının tasarımına yönelik; kullanıcı arayüzüne sahip, BLADESIGN isminde bir bilgisayar programı yazılmıştır.
Program, kullanıcının girdiği; istenilen türbin gücü, pala sayısı, dizayn rüzgar hızı ve pala profile ( airfoil tipi) girdilerine göre pala geometrisi parametreleri (veter uzunluğu ve burulma açısı dağılımları) ile dizayn şartlarındaki gerekli değerleri (dizayn uç hız oranı, dizayn güç katsayısı ve rotor çapı) vermektedir.
Program, pala tasarımı konusunda detaylı bilgiye sahip olmayan kullanıcılarına, programın verdiği sonuçları kullanarak başka konularda çalışmada bulunabilmesine imkan vermektedir.

CONCLUSION .
118 REFERENCES.
122    The wind continued to be major source of energy in Europe through the period just prior to the Industrial Revolution, but began to recede in importance after that time.
The reason that wind energy began to disappear is primarily attributable to its non-dispatchability and its non-transportability.
In addition to that, with the invention of the steam engine, the internal combustion engine and the development of electricity, the use of wind turbines was often neglected and abandoned [1].
Prior to its demise, the European wind turbines had reached a high level of design sophistication.
In the latter wind turbines, the majority of the turbine was stationary.
Only the top would be moved to face wind.
Yaw mechanisms included both manually operate arms and separate yaw rotors.
Blades had acquired somewhat of an airfoil shape and included some twist.
The power output of some turbines could be adjusted by an automatic control system [1].
The re-emergence of wind energy can be considered to have begun in the late 1960s.
Many people became awareness of the environmental consequences of industrial development.
Nearly all authorities concerning in energy began arguing that unfettered growth would inevitably lead to either disaster or change.
Among the culprits identified were fossil fuels.
The potential dangers of nuclear energy also became more public at this time.
Discussion of these topics formed the backdrop for an environmental movement which began to advocate cleaner sources of energy [2].
7  During the 1990s many wind power manufacturers spread all over the Europe, particularly Denmark and Germany.
Concerns about global warming and continued apprehensions about nuclear power have resulted in a strong demand for more wind generation there and in other countries as well.
Over the last 25 years, the size of the largest commercial wind turbines has increased from approximately 50 kW to 2 MW, with machines up to 5 MW under design.
The total installed capacity in the world as of the year 2001 was approximately 20.000 MW, with the majority of installations in Europe.
Offshore wind energy systems are also under active development in Europe.
Design standards and machine certifications procedures have been established, so that the reliability and performance are far superior to those of the 1970s and 1980s.
The cost of energy from wind has dropped to the point that in some sites it is nearly competitive with conventional sources, even without incentives [2].
Turkey has enormous wind energy potential as to European countries in that wind energy sources of Turkey are theoretically enough for meeting its electrical energy need.
83000 MW of this wind energy potential can be technically used for electricity production in Turkey, especially the region of Marmara, Ege, Bozcaada, Gökçeada, Sinop and the around of İskenderun are considered to have enough wind energy potential for the production of electricity.
Today the installed capacity of electrical energy production fro the wind energy in Turkey is 27 MW, 15 Mw of this amount of energy is from the established two wind farms in Çeşme and the other amount comes from the wind farm established in Bozcaada [5].
In Table 1.1, the wind energy potential and installed capacity of electrical energy production from the wind energy in some European countries by the year 1998 are given [6].
From this table it is seen that Turkey should utilize the wind energy for electrical energy production much more than its installed capacity now.

Developments in many other areas of technology were adapted to wind turbines and have helped to hasten re-emergence.
A few of the many areas which have contributed to the new generation of wind turbines include material science, computer science, aerodynamics, analytical methods, testing and power electronics.
Material science has brought new composites for the blades and alloys for the metal components.
Developments in computer science facilitate design, analysis, monitoring and control.
Aerodynamics design methods, originally developed for the aerospace industry, have now been adapted to wind turbines.
Analytical methods have now developed to the point where it is possible to have much clearer understanding of how a new design should perform than was previously possible.
Testing using a vast array of commercially available sensors and data collection and analysis equipment allows designers to better understand how the new turbines actually perform.
Power  9  electronics is relatively new area which is just beginning to be used with wind turbines.
Power electronic devices can help connect the turbine's generator smoothly to the electrical network; allow the turbine to run at variable speed, producing more energy, reducing fatigue damage and benefiting the utility in the process; facilitate operation in a small, isolated network; and transfer energy to and from storage [2].
The trends of wind turbines have evolved a great deal over the last 25 years.
They are more reliable, more cost effective and quieter.
It can not be concluded that the evolutionary period is over, however.
It should still be possible to reduce the cost of energy at sites with lower wind speeds.
Turbines for use in remote communities remain to be made commercially viable.
The world of offshore wind energy is just in its infancy.
There are tremendous opportunities in offshore locations but many difficulties to be overcome.
As wind energy comes to supply an ever larger fraction of the world's electricity, the issues of intermittency transmission and storage must be revisited.
There will be continuing pressure for designers to improve the cost effectiveness of wind turbines for all applications.
Improved engineering methods for the analysis, design and for mass-produced manufacturing will be required.
Opportunities also exist for the development of new materials to increase wind turbine life.
Increased consideration will need to be given to the requirements of specialized applications.
In all cases, the advancement of the wind industry represents an opportunity and a challenge for a wide range of disciplines, especially including mechanical, electrical, materials, aeronautical, controls and civil engineering as well as computer science [2].
10  The results are obtained from the program by giving the coordinates of an airfoil.
XFOIL first takes these coordinates and creates the contour geometry of the airfoil and finally by dividing the surface of the airfoil into a certain number of  104  panels, which can be changed by the user, gives the variations of lift coefficient and drag coefficient with respect to angle of attack.
In developing the airfoil database for the blade design program, the characteristics of airfoil have been obtained with the viscous mode analysis of XFOIL and for the Reynolds number in the order of 1 million and also Mach number has been setted to zero considering that the angular velocity of a HAWT blades does not become so great that the rotational velocity of the blade tips approaches to the velocity of sound.
5.2 BLADESIGN As it was stated before, the main objective of this thesis is to develop a userinterface computer program on HAWT blade design.
The main purpose of constructing such a program is to collect and represent all the studies of this thesis in a visual and more understandable way and also to provide a design program for the users who are dealing with HAWT blade design.
For all of these reasons a userinterface computer program on HAWT blade design was written.
The general view of the program and its working flow schematic are illustrated in Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4 respectively.
The main features of the program can be summarized as below: • The program was written on MATLAB, version 6 [29].
• The program gives various error dialog boxes in case of incorrect input data or requesting an output of a command before this command some other commands should be executed firstly and necessary outputs for the requesting command should be firstly obtained.
By so the program serves as a guide for the user to perform the design procedure step by step.
• The density of air, ρ is taken as 1.2 kg/m3 in some algorithms of the program for the calculation of rotor diameter.
105  • The program includes one input part and four output parts.
• Input part requires the following information; turbine power required in Watt, design wind velocity in m/s, the number of blades supposed to be used on the rotor and airfoil type to be used for the blade profile.
Here the design wind velocity is the average wind velocity of an area where the turbine or windfarm of similar turbines is to be set.
Following airfoils are currently available in the database; NACA 4412, NACA 4415, NACA 4421, NACA 23012, NACA 23015, NACA 23021, NACA 63-210, NACA 63-212, NACA 63-218, NACA 63-221 and SERIS809.
• The output parts are composed of design condition output, blade geometry output, 3-D visualization output and figures output.
Design condition output part gives the information for both designed blade and its modified blade.
These information are design power coefficient (CP), corresponding design tip-speed ratio (λd) and rotor diameter in meter to be constructed for the specified turbine power input.
Blade geometry output part shows the chord-length in meter and setting angle in degree for each blade element (for each station) and does this again for both designed and modified blade.
The number of stations in the program has been kept constant with 30 because it has been seen that the increase of number of stations does not change the blade geometry values considerably much.
The purpose of putting this output part is that these output information can be used for the prototype production of the design blade in further studies.
3-D visualization output part gives three dimensional views of the designed and modified blades on separate windows.
The last output part, figures output part illustrates the results with figures for both designed and modified blade.
The first figure shows the variation of power coefficient with tip-speed ratio, the second one shows the distribution of setting angle in degrees with respect to normalized blade length (r/R) and the last figure is 106  for the output of chord-length distribution, which is normalized with R, with respect to again normalized blade length (r/R) graphically.
These figures can be analyzed visually to compare the performance and blade geometry of designed and modified blade by making both of the outputs visible.
• If it is desired to change the input values for another design, the command 'change inputs' in the input part stands for this purpose.
By pressing this button, all the outputs will become vanished and the program gets ready for the new input values.
• Blade geometry output (chord-length and setting angle values for each station) can be saved to a file in the working directory with the command 'save blade geometries' or can be print out with the command 'print' and the program  closes with the command 'exit" under the file menu option.

Then the design tip-speed ratio at which the maximum power coefficient (i.e.
design power coefficient) can be obtained for the three-bladed rotor.
This design tip-speed ratio can be used to determine the rotational velocity of the rotor at design condition.
Finally rotor diameter is found out with the known values of design power coefficient and design wind velocity and required power.
(Equation 2.5.1)  109  Design conditions output part calculates the mentioned values for both  designed and modified blade.
Pressing the 'designed' and 'modified' pushbuttons in the design coefficient output part, those values shown in Table 5.1 will be obtained from the program.
Note that design tip-speed ratio is same for both blades because the designed blade is modified at its design tip-speed ratio.
Also note that when the designed blade is modified, the power is decreased by 10% of the designed one or for the same power output the rotor diameter should be increased by about 7% of the designed rotor diameter.

Note that as discussed in chapter 4 the working range of modified blade becomes very narrow with respect to that of designed blade for a fixed rotational speed rotor.
Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9 shows the three dimensional views of designed and modified blade for the sample blade design case as one activates the push buttons under the 3-D visualization output part.
Finally how the results which have been given in tabulated form here looks on the user-interface program for this sample blade design case are given in Figure 5.10.

The design angle of attack and corresponding glide ratios (CD/CL) for each airfoil are also put in this table in order to see the effect of glide ratio on the design power coefficient.
When the design power coefficients of the airfoils are compared, it is seen that the glide ratio decreases the design power coefficient as it was stated before.
And the reduction in design power coefficient of the designed blade becomes approximately 10% after modification of the designed blade.
Similarly for the same power output, the increase in the rotor diameter of the designed blade becomes about 5% after modification.
Table 5.3 Comparison of outputs for the airfoils (P= 50kW, U∞=10 m/s, B=3)  116  In Table 5.4 the rotor diameters for different turbine power outputs for both designed and modified blade are given.
It is seen that the modification of the design blade increases the rotor diameter but this increase may be accepted regarding the moderate loading of the modified blades as it was explained in chapter 5.
Table 5.4 Comparison of rotor diameters for different turbine power outputs (U∞=13m/s, B=3, SERI-S809)  117  CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSION In this study, aerodynamic design of horizontal-axis wind turbine blades was investigated and a user-interface computer program called as BLADESIGN was written on HAWT blade design software for the use of its outputs in further studies.
Wind turbine blades are the pivot of the other parts of a wind turbine in electricity production since they extract the energy from the wind and carry this energy to generators which produce electricity.
The interaction between the wind and the blades is related to the aerodynamic forces acting on the blades.
While the wind is passing through the area swept by a rotor it leaves its some part of energy on the blades resulting from this aerodynamic interaction.
Hence it is limited to the aerodynamic aspect during the study of HAWT blade design.
Aerodynamic theories related to HAWT blade design were investigated extensively.
Firstly the simplest aerodynamic model of a HAWT, the actuator disk theory was discussed.
The main outcome of this theory is that it is impossible to extract more than 59% of the usable amount of wind energy under the ideal conditions which were stated as the assumptions of this theory.
Since the actuator disk theory is an idealized model which will never be realized for real operation of wind turbines, the general momentum theory is then needed to be discussed.
The main outcome of this theory is a measure of the effects of rotation on the relative values of the induced velocities at the rotor and in the wake.
Although the general momentum theory predicts the rotor performance, it fails to give any information about the rotor geometry.
This deficiency requires the next discussion which is blade element theory.
In the blade element theory, the  118  equations required to find the torque and thrust force on the rotor were found in terms of blade geometry parameters.
The results of this theory provide to make relations between the rotor performance and rotor geometry.
The ultimate goal was to relate the results of general momentum theory and blade element theory in order to get the enough equations for HAWT blade design.
This was achieved in the discussion of blade element-momentum theory (BEM).
After the equations resulted from this theory were obtained, a tip correction method was applied to the theory.
In this study, linearized tip correction method was used to take the effect of number of blades into account.
This method uses Prandtl's tip correction factor which is related to the reduction of the circulation around a rotor blade.
It was also briefly explained about vortex theory for the purpose of giving the physical explanation of induced velocity definitions made in the previous theories.
The origin of axial and angular induction factors was explained and the assumptions of the previous theories were clarified with the explanation of this theory.
Blade design was performed beginning with the optimization of blade geometry aerodynamically.
Aerodynamic optimization for a wind turbine means to design a blade geometry which gives the maximum power output.
For the optimization, it was graphically shown that the effect of airfoil characteristics (glide ratio) and the tip-loss effect were negligible on rotor performance.
So the unique relationship was found between the relative wind angle and local tip-speed ratio for the determination of optimum condition for each blade element.
For a chosen blade profile and a tip-speed ratio, the setting angle and chord-length variation along the blade length were then calculated together with the power coefficients.
The calculations shows that power coefficient increases with increasing design lift coefficient and decreasing drag coefficient of blade profile.
This means that the development in profile data is needed for better optimization.
119  'In Chapter 4', HAWT blade design procedure is given based on the BEM theory.
Equations obtained from BEM theory in chapter 3 are modified considering various corrections including tip-losses and thrust coefficient modifications.
It is mentioned about the airfoil selection criteria in HAWT blade design.
How airfoil characteristics affect the performance of a blade is discussed as well.
Design procedure is then studied for a designed blade and the validity of an approximation used for determining the optimum relative wind angle for a certain local tip-speed ratio is explained and illustrated with figures.
Modification of the designed blade regarding the ease of fabrication is discussed, modification of chord-length distribution of the designed blade and modification of twist distribution of the designed blade are studied and the performance of modified blade is analyzed and compared with that of designed blade.
At the end of this chapter results are given with illustrative figures.
In blade design of HAWT the effect of parameters such as effect of Reynolds number, effects of number of blades etc.
are discussed and some explanatory comment for each parameter showing on the figures are made.
'In Chapter 5', the computer programs namely XFOIL used for airfoil analysis and the user-interface program on HAWT blade design; BLADESIGN developed on MATLAB are introduced.
An example of blade design performed on the mentioned program is given.
2  1.2 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF WINDMILLS Even though today's modern technology has firmly and rightly established the definition of wind turbine as the prime mover of a wind machine capable of being harnessed for a number of different applications, none of which are concerned with the milling of grain or other substances (at least industrialized countries), the term windmill was used for the whole system up to recent time, whatever its duty, be it generating electricity, pumping water, sawing wood.
Since here the historical development of wind machine is considered it is convenient and has certain logic in it to retain its term, windmill in its historic sense [1].
The windmill has had a singular history among prime movers.
Its existence as a provider of useful mechanical power has been known for the last thousands years.
The earliest mentions of the use of wind power come from the East India, Tibet, Persia and Afghanistan.
It is also mentioned that the wind power was used to play the organ instrument in İskenderiye about two thousands years ago.
Nearly all stories and the records we have about windmill from between the first and twelfth centuries come from the Near East and Central Asia and those regions of the world are generally considered to be the birthplace of the windmill.
The first record of the use of the windmill is seen in the tenth century in Persia.
Inhabitants who lived in Eastern Persia, which bordered on Afghanistan today, utilized the windmill, which were vertical-axis and drag type of windmill as illustrated in Figure 1.1.
The invention of the vertical-axis windmills subsequently spread in the twelfth century throughout Islam and beyond to the Far East.
The basic definition of the primitive vertical-axis windmills were imported in the later centuries such as placing the sails above millstones , elevating the driver to a more open exposure which improved the output by exposing the rotor to higher wind speeds and using of reeds instead of cloth to provide the working surface [1].
3  Figure 1.1 Early Persian windmill [2]  However, it lies in the fact that the vertical-axis Persian windmills never came into use in Europe.
At the end of the twelfth century, there was an efflorescence of a completely different type, the horizontal-axis windmill.
This development present second enigma in the technical development of the wind turbine that occurred some thousands years after the enigma left by Persian vertical-axis windmills [1].
Before European countries, horizontal-axis windmills were designed by Ebulİz (1153) from Artuk Turks and used in the region of Diyarbakır in 1200's.
However, Northwest Europe, particularly France, Germany, Great Britain, Iberia and the Low Countries are considered to be the first region that developed the most effective type of windmill, one in which the shaft carrying the sails was oriented horizontally rather than vertically as in the Persian mill.
In a relatively short time, tens of thousands of what it is called horizontal-axis European windmills were in use for nearly all mechanical task, including water pumping, grinding grain, sawing wood and powering tools.
The familiar cruciform pattern of their sails prevailed for almost 800 years, from the twelfth to the twentieth century [1].
The horizontal-axis windmill was a considerably more complex mechanism than the Persian vertical-axis windmill since it presented several engineering problems three major of which were transmission of power from a horizontal rotor shaft to a vertical shaft, on which the grindstones were set, turning the mill into the  4  wind and stopping the rotor when necessary.
But the adoption of horizontal-axis windmill is readily explained by the fact that it was so much more efficient [1].
In the historical development of windmills, it must be required the consideration of very innovative step that warrants somewhat more attention that it has received, the use of horizontal-axis windmills instead of vertical-axis ones.
Although the right angle gear mechanism allowed the rotor axis to be transposed from vertical to horizontal, the action of sails also had to be turned through 90°.
This was revolutionary because it meant that the simple, straightforward push of the wind on the face of the sail was replaced by the action of the wind in flowing smoothly around the sail, providing a force normal to the direction of the wind.
As a concept, it is indeed a sophisticated one that was not fully developed until the advent of the airplane at the end of the nineteenth century and the engineering science of aerodynamics [1].
The transition from windmills supplying mechanical power to wind turbines producing electrical energy took place during the last dozen years of the nineteenth century.
The initial use of wind for electric generation, as opposed to for mechanical power, included the successful commercial development of small wind generators and research and experiments using large turbines.
The advent and development of the airplane in the first decades of the twentieth century gave rise to intense analysis and design studies of the propeller that could immediately be applied to the wind turbine [1].
An innovative type of wind turbine rotor, the Savonius rotor, was named after its inventor, Finnish engineer S.J.
Savonius.
The inventor's interest had been aroused by the Flettner rotor ship with its large, rotating cylindrical sails.
.Wind passing over these cylinders created lift by the Magnus effect, which propelled the ship forward.
He was intrigued by the possibility of substituting wind power for the external motor power used to rotate these cylinders on the Flettner ship.
His experiments resulted in a rotor with an S-shaped cross section which, in its simplest form, could be constructed by cutting a circular cylinder in half longitudinally and  5  rejoining opposite edges along an axle, an illustration of a more modern one is given in Figure 1.2.
According to the inventor, the Savonius rotor achieved some popularity in Europe especially in Finland, but it has not prospered commercially as a means for driving an electrical generator.
It had advantages having high starting torque and the ability to accept wind from any direction; its drawbacks were low speed and heavy weight [3].
Figure 1.2 The Savonius rotor [3]  Another innovative rotor design introduced in the early 1930s was a type of vertical-axis turbine invented by F.M.Darrieus.
The Darrieus rotor, which is illustrated in Figure 1.3, has two or three curved blades attached top and bottom to a central column, accepting the wind from all directions without yawing.
This column rotates in upper and lower bearings and transmits torque from the blades to the power train, which is located below the rotor, where the maintenance is easier and weight is not quite so important [4].
6  Figure 1.3 Darrieus rotor [4] CHAPTER 2 HORIZONTAL-AXIS WIND TURBINES 1.2 INTRODUCTION A wind turbine is a machine which converts the power in the wind into electricity.
This is contrast to a windmill, which is a machine that converts the wind's power into mechanical power.
There are two great classes of wind turbines, horizontal- and vertical-axis wind turbines.
Conventional wind turbines, horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT), spin about a horizontal axis.
As the name implies, a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) spins about a vertical axis.
Today the most common design of wind turbine and the only kind discussed in this thesis in the view of aerodynamic behavior is the horizontal-axis wind turbines.
In this chapter, detail information about the conventional horizontal-axis wind turbines will be given but before that some unconventional and innovative horizontal-axis wind turbine concepts will be mentioned.
2.2 HORIZONTAL-AXIS WIND TURBINE CONCEPTS In Figure 2.1, various concepts for horizontal axis wind turbines are illustrated.
A few words are in order to summarize briefly some of these concepts to see the evolutionary process that led to modern horizontal axis wind turbine configurations used all over the world.
Enfield-Andreau type of horizontal axis wind turbine is a unique concept in which mechanical coupling between the turbine and the generator is eliminated by driving the generator pneumatically.
The turbine rotor has hollow blades with open tips and acts as a centrifugal air pump.
As illustrated in Figure 2.2, air is drawn in  11  Figure 2.1 Various concepts for horizontal-axis wind turbines [2]  12  through side vents in the tower shell, passing upward to drive an enclosed highspeed air turbine coupled directly to the generator.
After flowing through the rotor hub into the hollow turbine blades, it is finally expelled from the blade tips.
While the Enfield-Andreau turbine operated successfully, it had a low overall efficiency.
High drag losses in the internal flow paths were suspected to be the cause.
After it had been operated intermittently, it was shut down permanently after suffering bearing failures at the blade roots [1].
(a)  (b)  Figure 2.2 Enfield-Andreau turbine (a) General view (b) Diagram of the flow path [1]  The other concept is the multiple rotors in the same plane on a single tower which had been designed as a method of achieving high power levels with rotors of intermediate size.
Studies on this concept concluded that it was more cost-effective to use multiple turbines or larger turbines than to pay for the complex structure needed to support.
But today no actual design work (much less experimental work) was undertaken [1].
13  Another unconventional innovative wind turbine concept is a wind turbine composed of counter-rotating blades in other words multiple rotors on the same axis as illustrated in Figure 2.1.
This system differs from the multiple rotors on the same plane mentioned just before in that multiple rotors on the same plane increase net swept area while counter-rotating blades on the same axis does share the net swept area.
Advocates of such systems usually misunderstand the physics behind wind energy conversion.
The effects of induced velocity limit the theoretical maximum power coefficient of two rotors on the same axis to little more than that of a single rotor.
Counter-rotation does decrease the rotational energy lost in the wake, but this benefit is trivial compared to the costs of the second rotor and associated gearing.
These systems have rarely been successful, much less costeffective [1].
Another concept that appears periodically is the concentrator.
The idea is to channel the wind to increase the productivity of the rotor.
The problem was that the cost of building an effective concentrator which can also withstand occasional extreme winds has always been more than the device was worth [2].
2.3 MODERN HORIZONTAL-AXIS WIND TURBINES All those unconventional horizontal-axis wind turbines described in the previous section led to the conventional modern horizontal-axis wind turbines which are the wind turbine systems with a low-solidity rotor powered by aerodynamic lift driving an electrical generator, with all rotating components mounted on a tower.
Today's modern horizontal-axis wind turbines are generally classified according to the rotor orientation (upwind or downwind of the tower), blade articulation (rigid or teetering), number of blades (generally two or three blades), rotor control (pitch vs. stall) and how they are aligned with the wind (free yaw or active yaw).
14  Figure 2.3 shows typical upwind and downwind configurations along with definitions for blade coning and yaw orientation.
The term upwind rotor and downwind rotor denote the location of the rotor with respect to the tower.
The downwind turbines were favored initially in the world, but the trend has been toward greater use of upwind rotors with a current splint between 55% upwind and 45% downwind configurations [7].
Small wind generators are usually of the upwind type for two principle reasons: (1) a simple tail vane is all that is needed to keep the blades pointed into the wind and (2) a furling mechanism that turns the blades out of the wind stream to protect the machine from high winds is easier for design and fabricate for an upwind rotor.
The downwind configuration is usually preferred for larger machines, where a tail vane would not be practical.
One problem with the downwind configuration is tower shadow.
The tower acts as a barrier to the wind stream and each time a rotating blade passes the tower it is subjected to the changes in wind speed, which causes stresses that vary with the exact amount of wind blocked by the rotor [1].
Figure 2.3 Schematic of the two common configurations.
Upwind, rigid hub, three-bladed and downwind, teetered, two-bladed turbine [7]  15  The principal subsystems of a typical horizontal-axis wind turbine as shown in Figure 2.4 include [2]: • The rotor, consisting of the blades and the supporting hub • The power train, which includes the rotating parts of the wind turbine (exclusive of the rotor); it usually consists of shafts, gearbox, coupling, a mechanical brake and the generator • The nacelle structure and main frame; including wind turbine housing, bedplate and the yaw system • The tower and the foundation • The machine controls • The balance of the electrical system, including cables, switchgear, transformers and possibly electronic power converters  Figure 2.4 Major components of a horizontal-axis wind turbine [2]  16  A short introduction to the nomenclature illustrated in Figure 2.5 for both upwind and downwind HAWT together with the overview of components follows.
(a)  (b)  Figure 2.5 Nomenclature and subsystems of HAWT (a) Upwind rotor (b) Downwind rotor [1]  2.3.1 THE ROTOR SUBSYSTEM: The rotor consists of the hub and blades of the wind turbine.
These are often considered to be its most important components from both performance and overall cost standpoint.
The rotor may be single-, double-, three-, or four-bladed, or multi-bladed.
A single-bladed wind rotor requires a counter-weight to eliminate vibration but this design is not practical where icing on the one blade could throw the machine out of balance.
The twobladed rotor was the most widely used because it is strong and simple and less  17  expensive than the three-bladed rotor, but in the recent times three-bladed rotor type becomes more widely used one in that the three-bladed rotor distributes stresses more evenly when the machine turns, or yaws, during changes in wind direction.
For example a two-bladed rotor with a tail vane would yaw in a series of jerking motions because at the instant the rotor was vertical it offered no centrifugal force resistance to the horizontal movement of the tail vane in following changes in wind direction.
At the instant the two-bladed rotor is in the horizontal position its centrifugal force, which is at maximum, resists the horizontal movement of the tail vane.
The three-bladed rotor cures this problem, which produces a high level of vibration in the machine, by creating a steady centrifugal force against which the tail vane moves smoothly to shift the direction of the wind turbine [8].
An unconed rotor is one in which the spanwise axes of all of the blades lie in the same plane.
Blade axes in a coned rotor are tilted downwind from a plane normal to the rotor axis, at a small coning angle.
This helps to balance the downwind bending of the blade caused by aerodynamic loading with upwind bending by radial centrifugal forces.
Tower clearance (the minimum distance between a blade tip and the tower) is influenced by blade coning, rotor teetering and elastic deformation of the blades under load.
Often an axis-tilt angle is required to obtain sufficient clearance.
Two general types of rotor hubs are rigid and teetered.
In a typical rigid hub, each blade is bolted to the hub and the hub is rigidly attached to the turbine shaft.
The blades are, in effect, cantilevered from the shaft and therefore transmit all of their dynamic loads directly to it.
To reduce this loading on the shaft, a two-bladed HAWT rotor usually has a teetered hub, which is connected to the turbine shaft through a pivot called a teeter hinge, as shown in Figure 2.5(a).
Teeter motion is a passive means for balancing air loads on the two blades, by cyclically increasing the lift force on one while decreasing it on the other.

This chapter focuses on these programs, results from the programs and their applications in computer-aided design of horizontal-axis wind turbine blades.
XFOIL is firstly introduced by giving its capabilities on the analysis of an existing airfoil, design and redesign of new airfoil geometric parameters.
Since the aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil should be known numerically before designing a blade and all the information and experimental results performed on airfoils were given graphically in literature, XFOIL is very well fitted for obtaining lift coefficient and drag coefficient data with respect to angle of attack.
In this thesis only the function of this program related to the viscous analysis of existing airfoils has been used.
The required data are obtained from the program by performing on various existing airfoil types and used for the subsequent studies of blade design.
The procedure to obtain the data is described and the results of the program are also compared with the results given in literature to show that the program XFOIL gives fairly close values.
User-interface computer program, BLADESIGN written by using MATLAB is then described.
General view and working flow chart of the program are presented with the explanation of important properties and capabilities of the program.
All the commands and their functions in the program are also introduced for the users of this program.
Lastly sample blade design studies are given by specifying a set of input values.
According to these input values, the program is executed and the  101  corresponding outputs are illustrated in tabulated form and also compared with CP & λ, c/R & r/R and θ & r/R figures for both designed and modified blades.
1.2 XFOILP4 XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of subsonic isolated airfoils.
It consists of a collection of menu-driven routines which perform various useful functions such as: - Viscous (or incviscid) analysis of an existing airfoil, allowing • Forced or free transition • Transitional separation bubbles • Limited trailing edge separation • Lift and drag predictions just beyond maximum lift coefficient • Karman-Tsien compressibility correction - Airfoil design and redesign by interactive specification of a surface speed  distribution via screen cursor or mouse.
Two such facilities are implemented: • Full-Inverse, based on a complex-mapping formulation • Mixed-Inverse, allowing relatively - as: • New max.
thickness and/or camber • New LE (leading edge) radius • New TE (trailing edge) thickness Airfoil redesign by interactive specification of new geometric parameters such  102  • New camberline via geometry specification • New camberline via loading change specification • Explicit contour geometry (via screen cursor) - - - Drag polar calculation with fixed or varying Reynolds and/or Mach number Writing and reading of airfoil geometry and polar save files Plotting of geometry, pressure distribution and polars XFOIL was written by Mark Drela in 1986 with the name XFOIL 1.0 and after undergoing numerous revisions, upgrades and enhancements it becomes now strongly geared to practical airfoil development with its final revision name XFOILP4.
Further explanation about the use of XFOIL program can be found in reference [26], here only the part of XFOIL program which was extensively used for the development of blade design program will be described.
If it is remembered from the airfoil selection criteria in section 4.4, the design angle of attack should be selected such that the glide ratio is minimum at that value of angle of attack.
Therefore the variation of lift coefficients and drag coefficients of an airfoil with respect to angle of attack in the fully-attached regime are required.
XFOIL gives these data in a considerably excellent agreement with published polars as shown in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 for the airfoil NACA 4412 as an example.
The results of XFOIL has been compared with the reference polar data performed by Abbott and Von Doenhoff [27] and also from the reference Riegels [28] to see the validity of XFOIL results.
103  Figure 5.1 Comparison of XFOIL lift coefficient data with data in reference [28]  Figure 5.2 Comparison of XFOIL drag coefficient data with data in reference [28]     84  The radial variation in relative wind angle ϕ for different design conditions is shown in Figure 4.13.
The angle ϕ is high at all radial sections for the low design tip-speed ratio.
The increase in drag marginally reduces the angle ϕ .
The reduction in the number of blades reduces the relative wind angle at the low design tip-speed ratio, but the effect of number of blades is negligible at the high values of design tip-speed ratio.
In this study the modification of the designed blade shape has also been determined.
The modification of chord-length keeping the twist distribution same with that of designed blade, the modification of twist distribution keeping the chord-length distribution same with that of designed blade and modification of both have been separately determined and their performance have been compared.
The variations in twist angle and chord-length along the blade for different tipspeed ratios are shown in Figure 4.14 and Figure 4.15.
In Figure 4.16 and Figure 4.17, the variations in twist angle and chord-length for different tip-speed ratios are given after modifying the chord-length distribution of the designed blade.
Figure 4.18 shows the variations in modified twist along the blade length for different tip-speed ratios and the variation of angle of attack along the blade length for this blade whose twist distribution has been modified is shown in Figure 4.19 together with the design angle of attack and stall angle for considered airfoil.
Figure 4.20 shows the variation in angle of attack along the blade length for a designed blade whose both chord-length and twist distributions have been modified.
In Figure 4.21 power coefficients of modified blades are compared with that of designed blade.
It can be seen from these figures that the design power coefficient of modified blade, which is attained after modification of the designed blade performed in this thesis, is fairly close to the design power coefficient of the designed bade at different design tip-peed ratio.
Moreover, since the power  85  coefficient is directly proportional to the lift forces acting on the blade, modification of the designed blade causes the lift forces acting on the modified blade to decrease with regard to the lift forces acting on the designed blade preventing the blade from loading highly during its operation.
Radial thrust coefficient which is a measure of loading of rotor in the wind direction has also been calculated for the designed and the modified blade and shown in Figure 4.22 and Figure 4.23.
Again thrust force is also decreased for the modified blade as to the thrust force for the designed blade.
Off-design conditions of turbines have been taken into consideration and regarding the cut-in and cut-out speed, the working range of a fixed-rotational speed turbine has been determined separately for the designed blade and the modified blade.
As shown in Figure 4.24 and Figure 4.25 the working range of modified blade is drastically reduced with regard to that of designed blade.
The performance of a HAWT rotor during its operation at different average wind velocities is also studied.
In this study three-bladed HAWT rotor is designed for the required power production 50 kW and at the design wind velocity 8 m/s.
For these conditions the rotational velocity of the rotor becomes 76 rpm in case of using designed blade and 59 rpm for the modified blade.
And for different average wind velocities, corresponding power production of this three-bladed HAWT is obtained as shown on Table 4.2.
Since the power production is proportional with the cube of the average wind velocity (equation 2.5.1) and the power coefficient of the designed blade is nearly constant over a wide range of tip-speed ratio as illustrated in Figure 4.21, power production of HAWT rotor made up from the designed blades is gradually increasing as the average wind velocity increases.
Power production of a HAWT rotor made up from the modified blades, however, is not increasing very much as expected when its power coefficient variation with respect to tip-speed ratio shown on Figure 4.21 is analyzed.
86  The effect of Reynolds number on power performance of wind turbines has been studied.
Since two-dimensional airfoil characteristics depends on the Reynolds number, there should be effect on the power of turbines but as shown in Figure 4.26 it is not significant as expected.
In Figure 4.27 and Figure 4.28, the views of blade elements of NACA 4412 airfoil for the designed and its modified blade are shown.
As it can be seen from these figures, twist distribution of modified blade becomes smoother than that of designed blade.
Figure 4.29 and Figure 4.30 show the blade elements of NACA 4412 in isometric view for the designed and modified blade.
Note that the modification of the designed blade makes chord-length of some blade elements near the root bigger than that of designed blade but the variation of chord-length from root towards tip becomes linear for the modified blade as to the sharp variation for the designed blade.
Lastly, three-dimensional views of the designed and modified blade made from the airfoil NACA 4412 are illustrated in Figure 4.31 and Figure 4.32 for visualization.Teetering also reduces the cyclic loads imposed by a two-bladed rotor on the turbine shaft to levels well below those caused by two blades on a rigid hub.
A three-bladed rotor has usually a rigid hub.
In this case, cyclic loads on the turbine shaft are much smaller than those produced by a two-bladed rotor with a rigid hub, because three or more blades form a dynamically symmetrical rotor: one with the same mass moment of inertia about any axis in the plane of the rotor and passing through the hub.
A wide variety of materials have been used successfully for HAWT rotor blades, including glass-fiber composites, laminated wood composites, steel spars with non-structural composite fairings and welded steel foils.
Whatever the blade material, HAWT rotor hubs are almost always fabricated from steel forgings, castings or weldments.
2.3.2 THE POWER-TRAIN SUBSYSTEM: The power train of a wind turbine consists of the series of mechanical and electrical components required to convert the mechanical power received from the rotor hub to electrical power.
A typical HAWT power train consists of a turbine shaft assembly (also called a primary shaft), a speed increasing gearbox, a generator drive shaft (also called a secondary shaft), rotor brake and an electrical generator, plus auxiliary equipment for control, lubrication and cooling functions.
2.3.3 THE NACELLE STRUCTURE SUBSYSTEM: The HAWT nacelle structure is the primary load path from the turbine shaft to the tower.
Nacelle structures are usually a combination of welded and bolted steel sections.
Stiffness and static strength are the usual design drivers of nacelle structures.
2.3.4 THE TOWER SUBSYSTEM AND THE FOUNDATION: A HAWT tower raises the rotor and power train to the specified hub elevation, the distance from the ground to the center of the swept area.
The stiffness of a tower is a major factor in wind turbine system dynamics because of the possibility of coupled vibrations between the rotor and tower.
Located in the ground equipment station  19  are those components which are necessary for properly interfacing the HAWT with the electric utility or other distribution system.
2.3.5 THE CONTROLS: The control system for a wind turbine is important with respect to both machine operation and power production.
Wind turbine control involves the following three major aspects and the judicious balancing of their requirements [2]: • Setting upper bounds on and limiting the torque and power experienced by the drive train • Maximizing the fatigue life of the rotor drive train and other structural components in the presence of changes in the wind direction, speed, as well as start-stop cycles of the wind turbine • Maximizing the energy production 2.3.6 THE BALANCE OF ELECTRICAL SUBSYSTEM: In addition to the generator, the wind turbine utilizes a number of other electrical components.
Some examples are cables, switchgear, transformers and power electronic converters, yaw and pitch motors.
2.4 AERODYNAMIC CONTROLS OF HAWTS Horizontal-axis wind turbines use different types of aerodynamic control to achieve peak power and optimum performance control.
Nearly all turbines use an induction or synchronous generator interconnected with the utility grid.
These generators maintain a constant rotor speed during normal operation, so aerodynamic control is needed only to limit and optimize power output.
Variable speed control has been considered as a means of improving the aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor and reducing dynamic loads.
This type of control results in the rotor speed changing to maintain a constant ratio between blade tip speed and wind speed (tip speed ratio).
20  Medium and large-scale HAWT rotors usually contain a mechanism for adjusting blade pitch, which is the angle between the blade chordline and the plane of rotation.
This pitch-change mechanism, which may control the angle of the entire blade (full-span pitch control) or only that of an outboard section (partialspan pitch control), provides a means of controlling starting torque, peak power, and stopping torque.
Peak power is controlled by adjusting blade pitch angle to progressively lower angles of attack to control increasing wind loading.
Pitch control offers the advantage of more positive power control, decreasing thrust loads as blades pitch toward feather in high winds and low parked rotor loads while the turbine is not operating in extreme winds.
One disadvantage of pitch control is the lack of peak power control during turbulent wind conditions.
Some HAWTs have fixed-pitch stall-controlled blades, avoiding the cost and maintenance of pitch-change mechanisms by relying on aerodynamic stall to limit peak power.
Passive power regulation is achieved by allowing the airfoils to stall.
As wind speed increases stall progresses outboard along the span of the blade causing decreased lift and increased drag.
One disadvantage of stall-controlled rotors is that they must withstand steadily increasing thrust loads with increasing wind speed because drag loads continue to increase as the blade stalls.
Another disadvantage is the difficulty of predicting aerodynamic loads in deep stall.
In addition to partial-span and full-span pitch control, several types of aerodynamic brakes have been used for stall-controlled rotors.
A simplified form of aerodynamic control mechanism is a tip brake or tip vane, in which a short outboard section of each blade is turned at right angles to the direction of motion, stopping the rotor by aerodynamic drag or at least limiting its speed.
Pitchable tips and pivoting tip vane have been used with reasonable success.
A yaw drive mechanism is also required so that the nacelle can turn to keep the rotor shaft properly aligned with the wind.
An active yaw drive (one which turns the nacelle to a specified azimuth) contains one or two motors (electric or hydraulic), each of which drives a pinion gear against a bull gear and an automatic  21  yaw control system with its wind direction sensor mounted on the nacelle.
A  passive yaw drive permits wind forces to orient the nacelle.
2.5 PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS OF HAWTS The power performance parameters of a HAWT can be expressed in dimensionless form, in which the power coefficients, C p and the tip-speed ratio, λ are used.
These are given in equation 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 respectively;  Cp =  P 3 1/ 2 ρU ∞π R 2  (2.5.1)  λ=  ΩR U∞  (2.5.2)  Note that in equation 2.5.2, tip-speed ratio is defined for a fixed wind speed.
A sample C p & λ curve is given in Figure 2.6 for a typical HAWT operating at fixed pitch.
Figure 2.6 Typical plot of rotor power coefficient vs. tip-speed ratio for HAWT with a fixed blade pitch angle  22  To give a few comments on the operating points A, B, C and D shown in Figure 2.6 will help reading such C p & λ curves of HAWTs.
The left-hand side of Figure 2.6 following the path ABC is controlled by blade stall.
Local angles of attack (angles between the relative wind angle and the blade chordline) are relatively large as point A is approached.
The right-hand side of the same figure following the path CD is controlled by drag, particularly 'skin friction' because the angles of attack are small as point D is approached.
At fixed pitch maximum power occurs in the stall region when the lift coefficient is near its peak value over much of the blade.
Apart from the power coefficient, the thrust coefficient ,which will be used as well in the subsequent chapters for characterizing the different flow states of a rotor is defined as;  CT =  T 2 1/ 2 ρU ∞π R 2  (2.5.3)  2.6 CLASSIFICATION OF HAWTS Because the interconnection of wind turbines to utilities becomes their principal application, the average size of HAWTs has grown.
The question of 'size  classification' has been raised, as well.
HAWTs are classified as shown in Table 2.1 according to their diameters and/or their rated powers [1].
Table 2.1 Scale classification of wind turbines [1]  Scale Small Medium Large  Rotor Diameter Less than 12 m 12 m to 45 m 46 m and larger  Power Rating Less than 40kW 40kW to 999kW 1.0 MW and larger  23  In Figure 2.7 scales of HAWTs are given for the prescribed rated capacity to provide better understanding the relation between the rated capacity of a HAWT with its rotor diameter and tower height.
Figure 2.7 Representative size, height and diameter of HAWTs [2]  2.7 CRITERIA IN HAWT DESIGN Before ending this chapter, a few words to be mentioned in ref [8] about the criteria in HAWT design and construction include:  • Number of turbine blades • Rotor orientation; downwind or upwind rotor • Turbine torque regulation • Turbine speed; fixed or variable rotor speed • Blade material, construction method and profile (airfoil section)  24  • Hub design; rigid, teetering or hinged • Power control via aerodynamic control (stall control) or variable pitch blades (pitch control)  • Orientation by self aligning action (free yaw) or direct control (active yaw) • Types of mechanical transmission and generator; synchronous or induction generator; gearbox or direct drive transmission  • Type of tower; steel or reinforced -concrete shell or steel truss with tension cables  25 JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM FOR SMALL-SCALE PROJECTS - Version 01.1 Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee page 1  JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM FOR SMALL-SCALE PROJECTS Version 01.1 - in effect as of: 27 October 2006  CONTENTS A.

Description of the small-scale project:  The objective of the JI project is to establish two wind power plants with a combined capacity of 14 MW at Sudenu and Lendimu villages in Lithuania (JI Project).
The renewable electricity produced by the wind power plants will displace carbon intensive electricity produced from fossil fuel sources in the Lithuanian power network, thus contributing to the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions as well as other pollutants related to fossil fuel based power generation.
Lithuania has undertaken to increase the share of renewable electricity from current 3,5% to 7% by year 2010.
To comply with this undertaking Lithuania would need to achieve ca.
480 GWh electricity production only from wind energy.
This would amount to ca.
200 MW of installed wind power capacity.
The recently approved National Program of Increasing Efficiency of Energy Consumption for 2006-2010 states that potential of usage of renewable sector to produce electricity is growing 0.2-1% annually; wind energy is first priority, biomass energy second.
In order to give incentives for business of wind energy parks, the government has issued legislation1 regulating the obligatory purchase of wind power electricity.
The feed-in tariff is set to 0,22 LTL per kWh i.e.
6,37 EUR cents per kWh (1 EUR = 3,4528 LTL).
Such a feed-in tariff is expected to remain until 2020 year.
In order to obtain the mentioned feed-in tariff the wind power plant must be built in one of the six zones for which tenders for grid connection are organised by Lietuvos Energija AB - the electricity Transmission System Operator in Lithuania.
The set feed-in tariff is unfortunately not sufficient to realize the proposed project on a commercial basis.
Additional income from the sale of 'carbon credits' under the Kyoto Joint Implementation scheme is thus required to turn the project attractive for the investors.

Technology(ies) to be employed, or measures, operations or actions to be implemented by the small-scale project: The purpose of the project is the development, construction and operation of two wind power plants in Lithuania.
The power generation of these wind farms will displace carbon-intensive generation from the Lithuanian power plants.
Technology The project will employ state of the art wind turbine technology from one of the world's foremost equipment suppliers, Enercon.
The supplier was selected on the ground of earlier experience from other wind power projects.
The wind power plants will consist of 7 turbines of type E82 with nominal electric capacity of 2000 kW each.
The E82 wind energy converters will have a 78 m hub height steel towers and a 82m rotor diameter.

Any residual risks will be covered through the performance guarantees and operating warrantees of the supply agreement.
Wind turbine risks are low for modern equipment, but include the risk of critical component failure (e.g.
gearbox, bearings, blades).
As the equipment identified has fewer moving parts (i.e.
synchronous movement, no gears) these risks are inherently reduced.
The expected technical lifetime of the wind turbines is 20 years.
Milestones, time schedule and current status of implementation The project is currently in the advanced development phase with feasibility analysis completed and with the detailed technical design under elaboration.
Project financing (dependant also on securing carbon financing) is under completion with a view to wind farm erection during quarters 2-3 2008 and commissioning by August 2008.
Emission reductions would thus begin to be generated from 1st of September 2008.
Key permits and contracts Besides the low feed-in tariff, the main development barrier to wind projects in Lithuania is the securing of grid connection rights and planning permits.
This barrier has been effectively removed for this project.
Before take-over of the development rights for the Project by September 2006, Lariteksas UAB and Vejo Elektra UAB won a tender for grid connection in June 2004 and received permissions from the Ministry of Economy for development of the wind farms for Lariteksas UAB in July 2005 and for Vejo Elektra UAB in September 2004.
The latter permission has been extended in March 2007.
The grid connection fees have already been paid.
According to the agreement between UAB "V jo elektra" UAB "Lariteksas" and AB "Lietuvos energija", dated August 2006, the connecting electricity line (including any other necessary equipment) located in the parcels of land of UAB "V jo elektra" and UAB "Lariteksas" shall be installed by the companies themselves in compliance with the technical project approved by AB "Lietuvos energija".
The agreement prescribes that requirements for the supply of electricity into the electricity network of AB "Lietuvos energija", such as quality, quantity, timetables, accounting, readings, software, etc., shall be unilaterally set by AB "Lietuvos energija".
UAB "V jo elektra" and UAB "Lariteksas" may not exceed the power of electricity production prescribed to them.
In case of failure to comply with this obligation, AB "Lietuvos energija" may limit or terminate the supply of electricity into its electricity network.
The local Kretingos municipality has agreed to the establishment of the wind farms and approved the respective detailed land use plan in June 2006.
The project detailed technical design will be completed by summer 2007 on basis of which the building permit can be obtained.
Also an environmental impact assessment has been carried out and approved by the respective authorities.
The land has been rented to the project companies on a long-term basis.
The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the project has not yet been signed but is a formality under Lithuanian law once the grid connection rights have been secured.
The PPA will be secured by Q3, 2008.
The turn-key contract has already been agreed with the equipment supplier Enercon.
Local civil construction companies will be sub-contracted for construction of project infrastructure.

Risks during project implementation and operation Construction cost overrun risk is transferred to the turnkey supplier by the terms of the supply contract.
This includes total project management, including foundation construction and all civil engineering work.
Enercon will be responsible for installation and operation during the trial period.
Technology risks during construction and commissioning are similarly covered by the terms of the supply agreement.
The contract includes a two year warranty period which includes maintenance, consumables and spare parts, valid from the takeover certificate (at successful commissioning).
Risk is further reduced as the technology supplier is an established and creditworthy company.
Delivery risks during operation relate to operation of the wind power plant.
These include risks related to high wind, freak conditions, fire and lightning and vessel collision.
These will be minimised by employing best practice procedures.
The remaining risks will be assumed with the purchase of insurance products, incl.
business interruption insurance.
The energy yield estimate was calculated by EMD International A/S using measurements from a meteorological mast located on the site with 23-month measurement period.
The dataset was correlated with model data from NCAR/NCEP re-analysis data from 1975-2007 (32 years).
The measured data was corrected to long-term level using NCAR/NCEP data and the wind energy index method.
As the result of analysis the combined annual production capacity of the wind farms is estimated to be 28.988 MWh.
The estimate has a 90% probability of occurrence (P90) and can thus be considered very conservative.

These are covered through the PPA, which is required by law, with recourse to a creditworthy counterparty, AB Lietuvos Energia, the national power company.
The company operates in an EU business environment, with low levels of business and regulatory risk.
There remains however the risk of possible change of the feed-in tariff under the legislation.
There is also an uncertainty related to the expected sales price of power after the end of the obligatory purchase period in 2020.
A.4.4.
Brief explanation of how the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by sources are to be reduced by the proposed small-scale project, including why the emission reductions would not occur in the absence of the proposed small-scale project, taking into account national and/or sectoral policies and circumstances: The renewable electricity produced by the proposed wind power plants would displace carbon intensive electricity produced from fossil fuel sources in the Lithuanian power network.
Lithuanian electric power network is being operated by AB Lietuvos Energija.
Foremost, they purchase power quotas (on basis of the prior signed contracts) from electric power producers.
The producers may also supply electric power, exceeding the quotas, at a lower price.
The difference in national demand for the electric power and total production thereof (quotas and over-quotas) is being covered by AB Lietuvos Elektrine.
Thus, if the implementation of this JI Project fails, the estimated electric power would be produced by AB Lietuvos Elektrine using fossil fuels - natural gas, heavy fuel oil and orimulsion.
It was calculated that AB Lietuvos Elektrine, by generating 1 MWh of electric power, contributes to the pollution of atmosphere with 0.629 tonnes of CO2 (data of 2002-2005).2 See chapter B.1.
for more details of baseline calculation and next chapter for estimation of the GHG emission reductions of the JI Project which have been calculated conservatively on basis of the above carbon emission factor of 0.629 tCO2e/MWh and the expected power production.
The proposed JI Project supports Lithuania's objective to increase the share of renewable electricity from current ca.
3,5% to 7% by year 2010.
To comply with this undertaking Lithuania would need to achieve 480 GWh electricity production only from wind energy.
This would amount to ca.
200 MW of installed wind power capacity.
The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Energy3 points out promotion of consumption of renewable energy resources as one of the principal objectives of regulation of state energy sector activities.
The law provides that the state encourages the producers to generate electricity from renewable energy sources by imposing the "must carry" obligations.
The Rules for Imposing the Public Interest Service Obligations4 provide that supply licence holders are under the obligation to buy up electricity generated by producers (connected to the transmission system) by using renewable and spare energy resources, and to sell it to their customers.
In order to provide incentives for wind power development the government has issued legislation regulating obligatory purchase of wind power at a price of 0,22 LTL per kWh (6,37 EUR).
Such a feed-in tariff is expected to remain until year 2020.
In order to obtain the mentioned feed-in tariff the wind power plant must be built in one of the six zones for which tenders for grid connection are organised by Lietuvos Energija AB - the electricity Transmission System Operator in Lithuania.

JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM FOR SMALL-SCALE PROJECTS - Version 01.1 Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee page 12  The above feed-in tariff for wind power is unfortunately not sufficient for commercial development of the wind power sector.
Thus all recent wind power developments (e.g.
Rudaiciai wind power plant of UAB Veju Spektras and Benaiciai wind power plant of UAB Achema Hidrostotys) are being carried out under the JI scheme.
A recent report of the European Commission concludes for Lithuania that the progress up to now to increase the share of renewable electricity has been modest: "Amendments made in 2005 to the RES-E support system must lead to tangible results soon in order to reach the 2010 target of 7%".5 It is thus very unlikely that future project will proceed without further financial interventions from the Joint Implementation scheme.

Project approval by the Parties involved:  Written approval by the Host Party involved, including the necessary authorisations, will be attached to the final PDD.
The proposed JI Project has already been endorsed the Ministry of Environment with its communication from February 21 2007 "Concerning the approval of the Idea of Joint Implementation Project", Document no.
(10-5)-D8-1543.
Once the draft determination report is available, the necessary request to issue a host country Letter of Approval will be made to the relevant Lithuanian authorities.
The investor country approval will be issued by at least one of the investor countries to the TGF at the point in time when it is required, at the latest.
Currently the investor country approval according to the JI Supervisory Committee decision is needed when submitting the first verification report for publication.
SECTION B. Baseline B.1.
Description and justification of the baseline chosen:  The baseline is the amount of GHG that would be emitted to the atmosphere during the crediting period of the project, i.e.
in 2008-2012, in case the project was not implemented.
BASREC Regional Handbook on Procedures for Joint Implementation in the Baltic Sea Region (Version 2 - June 2006) indicates three methods of baseline approach: 1.
Existing actual or historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as applicable; 2.
Emissions from a technology that represents an economically attractive course of action, taking into account barriers to investment; 3.
Average emissions of similar projects undertaken in the previous 5 years, in similar social, environmental and technological circumstances, and whose performance is in the top 20 per cent of their category.
The baseline is calculated referring to historic data as this method is best suited for Lithuanian power market.
Approved CDM ACM0002 methodology is not used for the baseline calculation due to the following reasons: 1.
Lietuvos Elektrine, power plant with the second largest installed capacity in Lithuania (after Ignalina nuclear power plant -INPP) is operating on the power grid as a marginal plant.
It covers all power demand which is remaining after all other power producers have supplied their quota power to the grid.
Hence, by simply including all these power plants operating on the grid (excl.
INPP) would bias the Operating Margin emissions factor.
2.
There is an overcapacity of installed power in Lithuania, so only very few new power plants are built.
Because of that, it is impossible to calculate properly the Build Margin emissions factor.
Taking into consideration the specifics of the Lithuanian power market, the methodology based on historical data was developed in mid 2006 by a consulting company Ekostrategija.
The methodology is described below and was also used when developing the JI project of Rudaiciai Wind Power Park.
This template shall not be altered.
It shall be completed without modifying/adding headings or logo, format or font.
JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM FOR SMALL-SCALE PROJECTS - Version 01.1 Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee page 14  GHG emissions from production of electric power depend on type of fuel used and the efficiency of installations in which fuel is combusted.
Thus, for baseline calculation it is important to know which power plants will reduce production due to the supply of additional electric power, generated in a JI project.
This can be easily determined knowing the structure of Lithuanian power network.
When the manufacturers of electric power supply all quota power to integrated Lithuanian power grid, the rest of power demand is covered by power produced in Lietuvos elektrine (Lithuanian Power Plant).
Taking this into consideration, we can say that in case of additional power supply to the grid, the production will be reduced in Lietuvos elektrine.
Therefore, in order to calculate GHG emission reductions, resulting from implementation of JI projects related to production of electric power, it is necessary to know the amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere while producing 1 MWh of electric power in Lietuvos elektrine.
For determination of the baseline we use fuel consumption and production efficiency data provided by AB Lietuvos elektrine as well as production of electric and thermal power in Lietuvos elektrine in 2002-2005 (Table 1).

To calculate efficiency of thermal power production in Lietuvos Elektrine, we have considered the data for consumption of conditional fuel per 1 MWh of heat energy produced, presented by AB Lietuvos Elektrine.
These figures were obtained by using an internal enterprise's methodology and are presented in Table 5.

Calculations made by the technicians of AB Lietuvos Elektrine gave such results: 0.667 tCO2/MWhe for 2005 and 0.726 tCO2/MWhe for the period before 2012 forecast.
Considering the results of our calculation and ones presented by AB Lietuvos Elektrine it is possible to draw the conclusion that using emissions factor of 0.629 tCO2/MWhe would represent a conservative approach to the baseline as it would result in fewer CO2 reductions compared to the one calculated by AB Lietuvos Elektrine methodology.
Lithuania's National allocation plan for 2005-2007 forecasts an increase in Orimulsion share from 20% (56.9 Ktoe) in 2005 to 40% by 2008 in the fuel mix of Lietuvos elektrine.
The forecasted increase in the Orimulsion share, would definitely increase baseline emissions factor.
Hence, the current emissions factor - 0.629 tCO2/MWhe is considered to be conservative and will be used as an ex-ante value to calculate CO2 reductions from Sudenai and Lendimai Wind Power JI Project.
B.2.
Description of how the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by sources are reduced below those that would have occurred in the absence of the small-scale project: Additionality of the project is proven using the ver.
2 of the CDM Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality as approved by the CDM Executive Board.
Baseline calculation presented in Section B.1 shows that production of an additional 1 MWh of electric power reduces CO2 emissions at average by 0.629 tCO2.
With an estimated annual power production of 28.988 MWh the wind farms of the proposed JI Project would thus reduce CO2 emissions annually by 18.233 tonnes.

Sub-step 1b.
Enforcement of applicable laws and regulations: The existing legal and regulatory requirements in Lithuania is in favour of alternative B - continuation of the current situation and is not in favour of alternative A - proposed project activity not undertaken as a JI project activity.
The obligatory purchase tariff for wind power established by the governmental regulation on promotion of electric power produced from renewable sources7 is not sufficient for commercial development of the wind power sector.
(Sub-step 2c).
Step 2.
Investment analysis Sub-step 2a.
Determine appropriate analysis method Simple cost analysis (option I) is not applicable for the project as the income from sale of 'carbon credits' is not the only source of revenues for the project.
Benchmark analysis (option III) is not applicable either as no investment benchmarks for power sector exist in Lithuania.
The power market in Lithuania is still partly regulated.
Power producers are given quotas to deliver power at a certain price.
Over-quota power is delivered at the market price (lower than the quota price).
Both, quota and the power price differ on a case by case basis.
The investment comparison analysis (option II) will be used for this project as it is the only applicable method.
Sub-step 2b.
- Option II.
Apply investment comparison analysis NPV (Net Present Value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return), as the most common financial feasibility indicators will be used for investment comparison analysis.
NPV is the difference in the present values of cash outflows and inflows, the higher the NPV, the more attractive the project is for investors; IRR estimates the discount rate used in order to obtain NPV equal to 0.
IRR is commonly calculated on total investment (disregarding capital structure and depreciation rate) to compare the project with similar projects or on the equity part of investment, which is relevant indicator for investors.
Sub-step 2c.
Calculation and comparison of financial indicators Given investor requirements and the risks associated with this project, a higher long-term tariff is required to make the project financially viable if the project is not implemented as a JI project.

The prepayment from the sale of carbon credits can also be utilized as part of the equity capital.
For financial modelling a less conservative energy yield estimate of 33.708 MWh (as compared to the ERU estimate) has been used as the financial modelling period of 20 years is longer than the ERU generation period (5 years), thus it is more probable that the energy yield will meet the P50 estimate which has a probability of 50%.

Barrier analysis Sub-step 3a.
Identify barriers that would prevent the implementation of type of the proposed project activity: • One of the key barriers listed in the tool for additionality assessment is, "investment barriers ... Debt funding is not available for this type of innovative project activities."
This is also the case with the proposed JI Project in Lithuania, as neither debt funding would be available if the project did not have JI status.
JI revenue has been considered since the early stages of development of this project and is an integral part of financing the project.
No financial support for renewable electricity generation is foreseen under the EU structural funds or any other multilateral or bilateral sources.

JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM FOR SMALL-SCALE PROJECTS - Version 01.1 Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee page 21  •  Due to the real estate market boom that also affects the designated areas for wind power development in Lithuania (incl.
Kretingos), there is scarcity of land (at reasonable cost) for construction of commercial scale wind power parks Establishment of wind power plants has become more expensive over the past few years due to a change of leading wind turbine suppliers' pricing strategy, increasing price of components and raw materials (steel), and increasing civil construction price in Lithuania.
Tender rules for grid connection in dedicated zones require a significant initial down-payment which the developers are more willing to make when carbon financing is secured or foreseen.
There is insecurity regarding purchase of wind power when trading on hourly basis comes into effect after the establishment of the spot market.
AB "Lietuvos Energija" has the right to disconnect the wind power-plant park from the power network in case of the system overload.
The know-how related to wind power technology and project implementation has been limited in Lithuania.
•  • •  •  Sub-step 3 b.
Show that the identified barriers would not prevent the implementation of at least one of the alternatives (except the proposed project activity): • Fossil fuel based power generation in Lithuania does not face the same limitations on availability of finance and many projects may not even require external funding as they can be financed internally by AB Lietuvos Elektrine.
Also EU structural funds are available for new cogeneration power plants and for modernization of existing ones.
There is more know-how available for cogeneration than for wind power in Lithuania.
• •  Step 4.
Common practice analysis Sub-step 4a.
Analyze other activities similar to the proposed project activity: No commercial scale wind farms exist in Lithuania and all new projects are being implemented under the Joint Implementation scheme.
The JI projects would be excluded from the common practice analysis.

Discuss any similar options that are occurring: The only wind farm that was built in Lithuania (near Kretingale) by not utilizing the JI scheme is still not in operation.
Institutional and legal barriers prevented the wind farm from becoming operational.
The wind power technology and civil construction costs were also lower when that wind farm was built.
Step 5.
Impact of JI registration As explained in Step 2, if the project developer is able to sell the 'carbon credits' from the project activity, the additional revenue would improve the financial viability.
Also the example of other JI wind projects in Lithuania proves that with the JI status a wind project will be able to attract equity and debt financing, and overcome the barriers described in step 3.
Financial modelling proves that the financial income from sale of Emission Reduction Units during 200812 improves the IRR of the project by almost one percentage point and enables to generate a positive NPV of the investment, thus making the project attractive for the investors to undertake.
The prepayment from the sale of carbon credits can also be utilized as part of the equity capital, thus lowering the financial risk for the equity investors.

Greenhouse gas emissions of the baseline scenario will exceed the emissions of the project baseline scenario by 18.233 tCO2 per year due to the additionality of the project.
During the period of 2008-2012 the difference between GHG emissions of baseline and project scenarios will make 79.012 tCO2e.

The approval was drawn with subsequent remarks and proposals: 1.
Works of intense movement of land are possible only after archaeological research is made, and founded valuables are researched and moved into state storages.
2.
Monitoring of noise should be performed.
3.
Factual measurements of noise should be performed after the park of wind power stations is built.
Additional measures for decreasing of noise shall be planned after estimating of exceeded maximum allowed levels of noise.
4.

While preparing the detailed plan, in order to avoid shading of wind power stations in the morning hours crossing Sud nai botanical - zoological reservation territory, it is necessary to examine the possibility to move wind power stations from the reservation border, as there is the distance of only 70 m. from the closest planned wind turbine generator to the border of Sud nai botanical - zoological reservation.
6.
The means for liquidation of negative shading effect shall be planned while arranging of the technical design.
Considering the remarks and proposals listed above, the Decision Regarding Admissibility of Planned Economic Activities in the Environmental Perspective, issued by the Klaipeda Region Environmental Protection Department of the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Lithuania gives consent to pursuing the wind power station park plan pursuant to the EIA Report.
Environmental impact assessment of UAB Vejo Elektra Sudenai/Lendimai wind farm - 3 wind turbines of 6 MW An EIA was not necessary in the course of planning the Lendimai wind farm as stated in the official letter from State Service for Protected Areas under the Ministry of Environment "Concerning Environmental Impact Assessment" No.
V3-7.7-1096 issued on August 13, 2005 and in "Screening Conclusion Concerning Environmental Impact Assessment" of Klaipeda Regional Department of Environment of the Ministry of Environment of Republic of Lithuanian No.(9.14.5.
)-V4-3168 issued on September 6, 2005.
The above stated conclusion was drawn because (extract from the above mentioned document): "Considering the given information about the construction of three wind turbines at villages Sudenai and Lendimai, requirements of national legal acts and after the evaluation of protected natural valuables at Sudenai national botanical - zoological park (territory of European ecological net "Natura 2000" - Sudenai meadows) it is assumed that planned economical activity will not have significant negative effect on protected areas."
According to the "Screening Conclusion Concerning Environmental Impact Assessment" of Klaipeda Regional Department of Environment of the Ministry of Environment of Republic of Lithuania No.(9.14.5.
)-V4-3168 issued on September 6, 2005 the conclusion, concerning the environmental impact of the planned economic activity, was drawn that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the planned economic activity of UAB Vejo Elektra - installation and maintenance of wind power-plants - is not required.
The above stated conclusion was drawn because: • The planned economic activity is planned to be executed at a safe distance from inhabited localities • The planned wind turbine generators are widely used in European Union countries and their technical parameters match the standards of the best technology available in the EU.
• National Energy Strategy approved by the resolution No.IX-1130 of the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania of October 10, 2002 (Official Gazette., 2002, No 99-4397) schedules, that aiming to the best use local resources, including wind energy, and at the same time to reduce the import of fuel and to establish new work places as well as to improve the state of environmental protection, the State will promote the implementation of the projects on use of wind, water and sun power and the experience of installation and maintenance will be collected; • At the territory of the planned economic activity it is not forbidden to install and maintain the equipment of planned economic activity.
The planned wind farms will have no significant transboundary effects in Latvia as not settlements across the border are established in the vicinity of the wind farm.

If environmental impacts are considered significant by the project participants or the host Party, provision of conclusions and all references to supporting documentation of an environmental impact assessment undertaken in accordance with the procedures as required by the host Party: The Environmental impact assessment for Sudenai wind farm specifies the impact to the environment of the wind turbines to be built by Lariteksas.
Practically there are no natural flora community at the territory of wind parks.
The land area where wind parks will be located will occupy a insignificant area of land of agricultural needs, therefore the wind parks of UAB Lariteksas will not influence the flora of the territory.
As the wind farm is farther from Sudenai botanic-zoological reserve park, the wind park will not have major influence to the Sudenai park and territories important for habitat conservation protection values.
After the construction of wind turbines there will be some high-rise constructions of technological design that will rise above landscape elements.
It will change the visual characteristics of the territory.
The constructions of the wind parks will be seen from all near territories.
From further territories these constructions will be blocked off by forests (from regional road Skuodas-Darbenai and from road Butinge-Liepoja).
General view of wind parks will be seen from Benaiciai-Sudenai villages, where only a few inhabitants live.
The wind parks on Impilties mound will be blocked off by other natural elements - forests, trees.
The full view of wind parks will be seen from Latvian side and from of other side of the valley of the river Sventoji.
The assessed zone of shading impact shows that the discomfort caused by shading will be experienced by two farms to the North East from the wind farm.
Compensatory means are planned for them.
Compensatory means for farms nearest to the wind farm would include plants which would cover wind power stations at the time when the shadow of the wind power stations covers the farms.
The plants will be planted only after the owners of the farms approve them because it would be effective if only they would be planted near these farms (on their private territory).
If necessary, the shadow shutdown system of Enercon will be utilized in order to reduce shadow flickering at the residential areas as well as at Sud nai botanical-zoological reservation territory.
This system is able to detect the lighting conditions and to decide whether periodical shadow flickering is possible.
The system shuts down wind turbines during shadow casting periods at emission sites taking weather conditions into consideration.
Detailed calculations of the shadowing effect prepared by Enercon indicate that in the worst case the possible reduction of the production would be 100 hours per year which equals ca.
1% of the annual production.
The real reduction will be much lower as the worst case calculation assumes that: - the sun is shining all day from sunrise to sunset, - the rotor plane is always perpendicular to the line from the wind turbine to the sun, - the wind turbine is always operating.
According to the preliminary calculations, when the noise level of one wind turbine is 102.1 dB (A), the total noise level caused by four wind turbines will decrease down to 45 dB (A) at the distance of 172215 meters.
In order to avoid the negative impact of noise on people in the neighborhood, the wind farm must stand at least 215 m away from the nearest farms.
Under the Laws of Lithuania, the noise level requirements are regulated by hygiene norm HN 33-1:2003 "Acoustic noise.
Allowed levels in residential and labouring environment.
Common requirements of method of measurement" approved by The Order of Minister of Medical Security No.

JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM FOR SMALL-SCALE PROJECTS - Version 01.1 Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee page 35  September 3, 2003 ("HN").
HN stipulates maximum allowed level of noise in the territories of residential accommodations, as provided below: Object Level of sound, equivalent level of sound, dBA 55 50 45 Maximum level of sound, dBA 70 65 60 Hours of a day  Territory of residential accommodations  6-18 18-22 22-6  The electromagnetic radiation caused by the wind power stations park will have no negative impact on human health (it will not exceed the permitted norm of 15 kV/m and will not even amount to 0.5 kV/m).
The beams have only negative impact close to 110 kV line and in a range close to generators, which are located at a 80 meters height.
Electromagnetic radiation may have negative impact only on telecommunication signals (as shown of the experience of analogous activity).
If such experience occurs the manager of planned activity and the individual that has suffered from the effect of electromagnetic radiation on telecommunication signal should identify the reason of such event and implement means of technical compensation at the expense of manager.
As for the risk of possible accidents, the wind power station towers will stand at the distance of 145 meters from the regional road "Darb nai - Laukžem ".
No other steadings, farms or halls are situated further than 145 meters from the wind power station towers.
According to "Sanitary Preservative Zone Boundaries' Establishment and Schedule Regulations" and according to "Special Conditions of Use of Land and Forest" the normative sanitary preservative zone for a wind farm is not set.
There are no registered immovable cultural valuables in the territory of planned wind power station.
The closest immovable cultural valuables are in 600-700m from the wind park therefore this park will not have any negative influence on these valuables.
There were no possible negative impact on recreational and tourism resources of the region found during the EIA.
The EIA report was examined by several institutions which presented their evaluations.
Conclusions of the authorities that evaluated impact on the environment were as follows: 1.
The Administration of the Klaipeda County Governor by its Letter No.

m each), one for the transformer substation (1800 sq.
m) and one larger agricultural land plot within which all the smaller land plots are situated.
Detailed planning of the above land plots started after adoption by the Council of the Kretinga District Municipality of its Ordinance of 29 July 2004 No.
T2-246 and conclusion by the Company of the Agreement on Transfer of Detailed Planning Organizers rights with the Kretinga District Municipality (Director of Administration of the Municipality) as the formal Organizer of the planning, on 5 August 2004.
In the process of territory detailed planning the various sanitary protection zones of the wind power stations ranging from 120 m to 300 m from the axis of the wind power stations were set down.
In the process of preparation of the detailed plan, the consents of the owners of the adjacent land plots, which will be affected by the shadowing and noise were obtained, whereby they consented with the effect of shadowing and noise to their land plots as made by the power stations.
The detailed plan further states that in noise sensitive areas the wind turbines may at night work at reduced speed and power.
If necessary the level of noise generated at night may thus be reduced.
The detailed plan provides that due to shadowing generated by the wind power stations the compensatory measures can be introduced.
Vegetation could be planted at the territories of the nearing farms and upon obtaining of the consents of the owners.
Also the Minutes of the Hygiene Expertise of the Project Documents, dated 7 June 2006, state that compensation measures are to be foreseen to reduce the shadow effect.

Although current technology has been based mainly on land-based wind turbine designs, more turbines are being designed specifically for offshore applications.
New standards have been developed to address the unique design environment imposed by loading from both turbulent wind acting on the blades, rotor nacelle assembly (RNA), and ocean wave forces acting on the support structure.
The rapid growth of offshore wind applications has presented new challenges to wind turbine engineers.
Technology unique to offshore oil and gas industry must be joined with the design technology for wind turbines.
This paper is a short overview of some of the challenges facing the growth of offshore wind technology.
Keywords: Wind turbine, offshore, floating, hydrodynamic behavior  Introduction Offshore wind turbines are not a new idea.
Heronemus [1] proposed them more than 30 years ago.
His idea was a floating concept that would produce hydrogen that would feed a pipeline to shore.
Since then, although offshore technologies are still in their infancy, land-based wind turbines have gown in number, size and improved economics.
Today the cost of land-based wind energy rivals that of most fossil fuels and is likely to be less expensive than new "clean" coal.
This success story can be credited to three advancements, 1) dramatic reductions in turbine costs, 2) improved reliability and 3) economies of manufacturing scale.
The first two advancements were a result of improvements in design techniques and design tools.
Engineers learned through exhaustive testing that the analytical tools they used for earlier machines were not adequate for predicting fatigue loads and extreme loads-the loads that drive the designs.
Inaccurate predictions lead to premature failures.
This realization led to extensive research in U.S. and European laboratories.
Aerodynamics research was performed.
Aeroelastic dynamics models were developed.
Finally, standards were developed.
All of this work evolved into a more mature design process that is currently implied in a suite of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards [2].
It took 15 years for the teams of engineers that developed these different standards to reach a consensus on difficult topics such as a standard set of design external conditions and extreme environment conditions, critical design load cases, methods to arrive at acceptable extreme loads and fatigue loads, testing methods to verify their analyses and certification methods that would ensure consistent quality.
The result was a far more reliable and economical fleet of turbines.
It also created a basis for educating the next generation of wind energy engineers.
However, very little of this type of research was done for offshore development until Europeans began experimental projects in the shallow waters surrounding Denmark [3].
The third advancement was due to consistent national policy that created a positive economic environment, mainly for Denmark and Germany.
Offshore meteorological and ocean (met/ocean) environmental conditions add to the engineering challenge.
In addition to turbulence loading exciting dynamically active structures, there are powerful ocean waves that randomly excite the same structure.
This is significantly different than the relatively static structures for offshore oil and gas operations.
Although these structures can be flexible, none of them have dynamically active rotors introducing nonlinear loads to the load spectrum.
Adding another stochastic load to the design effort requires nonlinear time series analyses using coupled aeroelastic/hydrodynamics analyses.
Hydrodynamic analyses require modeling the physics of both waves and the structure's dynamic response to them.
Aeroelastic analyses require time variant aerodynamic loading interacting with a dynamic structure.
Both can be extremely complicated, but rarely are they combined into a coupled analysis.
This presents an entirely new challenge.
1  These challenges will limit maturity and innovation in offshore wind energy until adequate research is devoted to it developing and validating design tools.
Over the past 10 years [3] projects have been deployed in waters less than 20 m in depth using existing structural dynamic codes adapted from offshore oil and gas technology and the wind industry (decoupled).
All have been fixed bottom support structures, making the dynamic analyses easier, mainly because they can be treated separately.
The reason offshore deployment has happened in Europe and not places like the United States is the economic stimulants favorable to wind energy in Europe.
Governments have provided long-term commitments to supporting renewable energy.
Also, land-based wind resources are not as great as offshore resources, and high population density discourages large-scale wind farm developments like those common in the western and Midwestern United States.
Finally, the waters surrounding many northern European countries are shallow enough to make relatively inexpensive support structures possible.
This picture changes for U.S. waters.
While the United States has plentiful offshore wind resources, shallow water depths are not as plentiful as they are in Europe.
Water depths for sites more than 5 km offshore are more likely to exceed 20 m, forcing developers to consider alternative support structures.
These are likely to become more expensive [4], The following report gives a short overview of some of the technical challenges and possible future challenges.
Current Technology As wind turbine technology has scaled up to meet demand, the cost of energy (COE) has dropped.
The reason for this is partly that the cost of maintenance and infrastructure favors fewer machines per total wind farm capacity and partly because the cost of shipping individual turbine components to various site locations has not been prohibitively expensive.
Also, turbine costs per rating have not dramatically increased with size as shown by Malcolm et, al [5].
This last point runs counter to engineering physics.
Physical principles would suggest that turbine costs would increase as the third power of the rotor diameter, yet power only scales with the square of the diameter.
This suggests that as turbine diameter increases, the amount of material (and hence cost) would out pace power (and hence energy) available.
In other words, physical principles would suggest that turbines should get more expensive with increasing rotor diameter.
This is explained by Manwell [6] and others in wind energy text books.
However, engineers have been able to keep the cost per rating nearly constant for wind turbines through continued technology improvement and innovation.
This trend continued until components such as the blades and tower base sections became so large that they could no longer be easily shipped over normal roadways.
Figure 1 shows this trend for commercial machines such as Vestas (V80, V90) and Siemens turbines compared to strict scaling without technology innovation as shown by Malcolm [5] in the WindPACT studies.
The commercial turbines have been able to actually reduce their specific RNA mass with increasing diameter by applying technology innovations with each new turbine model.
However, as turbine diameters exceeded 1.5 to 2.0 MW ratings, the shipping costs began to sharply rise.
This fact supports offshore applications for larger machines because of the relatively low cost of transportation over waterways that have virtually no restrictions on component size.
But the dramatic increase in installation costs for offshore applications has driven overall costs up.
When you add the increase in operations and maintenance cost at sea, offshore wind WindPact Baselines energy looses its low transportation WindPact Task#5 Final RNA Mass / Swept Area cost advantage.
NREL Baseline 5MW 40.0 35.0 Mass/swept area (kg/m^2) 30.0 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0  While the wind industry will agree that the cost of offshore wind energy is higher than land-based, many argue that offshore wind energy is still cost competitive with land-based fossil fuel generation when environmental impacts are added into the cost equation.
Furthermore, industry expects technology improvements to pave the way for the same kind of cost reductions that have made land-based  GPRA 2005 - 2025 Estimates RePower 5MW  Offshore Turbines  Enercon 6MW V120 4.5MW MultiBrid 5MW GE 3.6MW V80 V90 Siemens  Path to 3.5 cents/kwh, DOE onshore goal 40 60 80 100 120 140 Diameter (m)  0.0  Figure 1: Impact of Maturing Technology and Innovation on Specific Rotor Nacelle Mass with Increasing Rotor Diameter  2  wind energy a viable alternative.
For this reason, efforts to evolve offshore wind turbine technologies continue.
Today there are several 5-MW wind turbine prototypes and one commercially available.
These are shown inside the circle of Figure 1.
Most of these turbines were designed using land-based standards such as IEC 61400-1 [2] plus draft versions of IEC 61400-3 [2] for offshore turbines.
But this standard has not been approved through national vote at this time and it does not cover floating turbines.
In addition to international standards, turbines have been designed using GL [7] and DNV [8] guidelines.
Design Tools and Methods The complexity of the task to develop accurate modeling tools will increase with the degree of flexibility and coupling of the turbine and platform.
Usually this results in greater dynamic responses to wave and wind loading.
Predicting wave loads and dynamic behavior for a stable fixed bottom platform is a challenge, but it has been done, as shown by Passon [10].
However, these codes must be validated just as the land-based codes were validated using test data and code-to-code comparisons.
The IEA [11] is currently engaged in an exercise to verify the dominant analytical codes today.
Passon [12] describes this valuable task of comparing predicted loads and motions by most of the top analytical experts in Europe and the United States.
The coupled dynamics of floating support structures are even more difficult.
Jonkman [9] and Hansen [14] have shown how this can be done by joining proven wind turbine aeroelastic codes with hydrodynamic modules.
Platforms such as tension leg platforms will require new analytical tools but are likely to be less difficult to design than platforms that are more susceptible to wave loading.
Platforms, such as barge concepts, that have a large part of their structure near the free surface will have larger pitch, roll, and heave forces.
A barge is likely to violate simple Morison's Equations assumption, which will be more complex to model and validate.
Spar concepts will have smaller tower top motions relative to the barge but may still be subject to nonlinear wave forces requiring more advanced tools.
Support Structures Figure 2 illustrates a variety of offshore support structures that are in use or under consideration.
The first is a gravity foundation which, as the name implies, relies on gravity to secure it to the bottom.
These work well in very shallow water where the seabed can be prepared using surface vessels and the foundation can be cast in concrete and floated to the site for placement.
The second is by far the most popular.
It is a "monopile" and has been used in waters around Denmark and the United Kingdom.
The third is a tripod.
This could be used in water with depths of more than 20 m. It capitalizes on offshore oil and gas experience.
A jacket structure, which is more common to oil and gas truss structures, was used in the Beatrice project [15] in 45 m •Figure 2: Investigated support structure concepts water depths off the coast of Scotland.
The fourth within the IEA Wind Annex 23 - OC3 project [4] example is a floating support structure.
The IEA Offshore Code Comparison Collaborative (OC3) [11] project will compare predictions from various hydroelastic codes for all of these types of support structures.
Future Offshore Technology Offshore wind technology will continue to evolve.
For land-based machines, the most obvious evolution over the past two decades has been rotor diameter scaling.
Now, with industry developing machines with 100-m diameter rotors, the scaling race is slowing for land-based wind turbines, but for offshore turbines, the scaling evolution is likely to continue.
There are several 5-MW and even 10-MW turbines in development or on the drawing boards, but only one is being offered for commercial sale.
Companies have experienced the difficulty of reliable offshore operation and are wary of deploying turbines before they have proven reliable performance.
On the other hand, many recognize there is a very large market for offshore turbines, particularly an economic floating turbine for deep water applications.
Butterfield et al [16] outline the importance of floating turbines as  3  well as the technical challenges.
As turbines are designed specifically for the offshore application many innovations are likely to be tested.
The following are a few of the most likely.
Light-Weight Turbines Offshore wind turbines are dramatically affected by weight.
Weight aloft tends to cascade down the support structure, increasing the cost all the way to the foundation.
Both static and dynamic loads are increased.
Light-weight rotors will be more flexible and shed dynamic loads, which will reduce the required support structure.
More expensive materials might be used in an effort to control flexibility while reducing weight.
For example, it might pay to use more carbon in the blades if it reduces material cost elsewhere in the structure.
It might also pay to make the blades dramatically more flexible to shed load.
The challenge with this design strategy is deflection control.
The blades must clear the tower.
Downwind Rotors With upwind rotors blade deflection is limited by the tower clearance.
IEC standards limit the allowable minimum clearance under extreme loading conditions.
This has resulted in turbines with up-tilt in the rotornacelle axis, forward coned blades and even forward curved blades.
All these configuration choices lead to increasing the loads in the blades and the nacelle.
Blades are no longer load limited.
They are deflection limited.
Almost three decades ago downwind turbines were common for the obvious load relieving advantages.
Wind thrust loads tend to deflect blades downwind, away from the tower.
In other words, the average tower clearance would increase rather than decrease with increasing thrust loads, as they do with all modern upwind turbines.
The reason designers moved away from downwind turbines is that local residents were annoyed by the low frequency noise caused by blades passing through the tower shadow.
In northern Europe this is a critical issue.
However, much has been learned over the years about noise and how to mitigate it.
Tower shadow noise has not been a major research topic, because the northern European industry chose to avoid it by designing upwind rotors.
Now, that choice is limiting the flexibility of the blades.
However, most offshore turbines will be placed far enough away from dwellings that it is not likely to matter if turbines make more noise.
Furthermore, research of tower shadow physics is likely to lead to solutions to mitigate tower shadow noise.
Two blades Two-bladed turbines were dropped by the European market for aesthetic reasons.
However, it is possible that cost advantages of one less blade will bring designers back to this idea.
In the late 70s and early 80s, there were several commercial two-bladed designs.
Many were technically viable but needed more development to resolve engineering problems.
Some researchers have suggested that offshore turbines would benefit from the lighter weight of two-bladed concepts [17].
Floating Support Structures The vision for large-scale offshore floating wind turbines was introduced by Professor William E. Heronemus at the University of Massachusetts in 1972 [1], but it was not until the mid 1990's, after the commercial wind industry was well established, that the topic was taken up again by the mainstream research community.
Current fixed-bottom technology has seen limited deployment to water depths of 20 m. As the technology advances into deeper water, floating wind turbine platforms may be the most economical means for deploying offshore wind turbines at some sites.
Worldwide, the offshore wind resource has been shown to be extremely abundant, with the U.S. energy potential ranked second only to China [4].
Strategy for Economic Floating Wind Turbines Floating platforms for wind turbines must be optimized to achieve the lowest life cycle cost of the entire system.
Unlike land-based installations, the cost of offshore wind is not dominated by turbine costs, but by multiple balance-of-station (BOS) and operating expense (OPEX) factors.
When floating wind turbines are introduced, a large focus must be placed on limiting foundation costs, but at the same time intelligent systemengineering decisions must be made to ensure that platform costs do not drive up the cost of other critical cost elements.
More optimistically, floating platforms introduce a new design paradigm that may offer unique opportunities to reduce the weight and cost of companion systems.
4  Floating Platform Classification As mentioned earlier, floating platform configurations may vary widely.
Typically, the overall architecture of a floating platform will be determined by a first-order static stability analysis, although there are many other critical factors that will determine the size and character of the final design.
However, once the platform topology has been established, a crude economic feasibility analysis becomes possible.
Therefore, to focus the discussion, a classification system was developed that divides all platforms into three general categories based on the physical principle or strategy that is used to achieve static stability: 1) Ballast: Platforms that achieve stability by using ballast weights hung below a central buoyancy tank that creates a righting moment and high inertial resistance to pitch and roll and usually enough draft to offset heave motion.
Spar-buoys like the one shown in Figure 3 apply this strategy to achieve stability [4].
2) Mooring Lines: Platforms that achieve stability through the use of mooring line tension.
The tension leg platform (TLP), like the one shown in the center of Figure 3, relies on mooring line tension for righting stability [4].
3) Buoyancy: Platforms that achieve stability through the use of distributed buoyancy, taking advantage of weighted water plane area for righting moment [4].
This is the principle used in a barge shown in Figure 3.
Unique Offshore Challenges The challenges that all offshore turbines will face are: • • • • • Installation cost Reliability Operations and maintenance at sea Remote monitoring and diagnostics Validation of extreme loads  The challenges for floating systems add the following to this list: • • • • • Static and dynamic stability Load prediction code validation Large motion and acceleration tolerant turbine design Light-weight turbine design Low-cost mooring systems & anchors  Conclusions Offshore turbines present a new set of engineering and economic challenges.
Although the engineering challenges are surmountable using established offshore oil and gas technology, innovation will be needed to meet the economic challenges to offshore wind technologies and to achieve economically viable, reliable operation for at least 20 years.
For floating systems, these challenges are even more unique and demanding.
Research, testing and standards will all play an important role.

Z39.18  F1147-E(09/2007)   Wind Turbine Technology  BWEA Briefing Sheet Wind Turbine Technology  Since earliest times, man has harnessed the power of the wind, with the first mill recorded as long ago as the 6th century AD.
The technology has diversified over the years to include pumping water, grinding grain, powering sawmills and most recently generating electricity, now the fastest growing energy sector worldwide.
Wind turbine technology has developed rapidly in recent years and Europe is at the hub of this hightech industry.
Wind turbines are becoming more powerful, with the latest turbine models having larger blade lengths which can utilise more wind and therefore produce more electricity, bringing down the cost of renewable energy generation.
The first commercial wind farm in the UK, built in 1991 at Delabole in Growth in size of commercial wind turbine design © EWEA Cornwall, used 400 kilowatt (kW) turbines, while the latest trials have involved turbines ten times more powerful, of four megawatts (MW) and above.
The average size of an onshore wind turbine installed in 2005 was approximately 2 MW.
Wind turbines have an average working life of 20-25 years, after which the turbines can be replaced with new ones or decommissioned.
Old turbines can be sold in the second hand market and they also have a scrap value which can be used for any ground restoration work.
1  How Does a Wind Turbine Work?
Wind turbines produce electricity by using the natural power of the wind to drive a generator.
The wind is a clean and sustainable fuel source, it does not create emissions and it will never run out as it is constantly replenished by energy from the sun.
In many ways, wind turbines are the natural evolution of traditional windmills, but now typically have three blades, which rotate around a horizontal hub at the top of a steel tower.
Most wind turbines start generating electricity at wind speeds of around 3-4 metres per second (m/s), (8 miles per hour); generate maximum 'rated' power at around 15 m/s (30mph); and shut down to prevent storm damage at 25 m/s or above (50mph).
Wind Turbine Technology Generating electricity from the wind is simple: Wind passes over the blades exerting a turning force.
The turbine rotating blades turn a shaft inside the nacelle, which goes into a gearbox.
The gearbox increases the rotation speed for the generator, which uses magnetic fields to convert the rotational energy into Components of a typical wind  www.embracewind.com  www.bwea.com  electrical energy.
The power output goes to a transformer, which converts the electricity from the generator at around 700 Volts (V) to the right voltage for the distribution system, typically between 11 kV and 132 kV.
The regional electricity distribution networks or National Grid transmit the electricity around the country, and on into homes and businesses.
Offshore Technology Offshore wind farms are an exciting new area for the industry, largely due to the fact that there are higher wind speeds available offshore and economies of scale allow for the installation of larger size wind turbines offshore.
Offshore wind turbine technology is based on the same principles as onshore technology.
Foundations are constructed to hold the superstructure, of which there are a number of designs, but the most common is a driven pile.
The top of the foundation is painted a bright colour to make it visible to ships and has an access platform to allow maintenance teams to dock.
Subsea cables take the power to a transformer, (which can be either offshore or onshore) which converts the electricity to a high voltage (normally between 33 kV and 132 kv) before connecting to the grid at a substation on land.

Operation and Maintenance Both onshore and offshore wind turbines have instruments on top of the nacelle, an anemometer and a wind vane, which respectively measure wind speed and direction.
When the wind changes direction, motors turn the nacelle, and the blades along with it, around to face into the wind.
The blades also 'pitch' or angle to ensure that the optimum amount of power is extracted from the wind.
All this information is recorded by computers and transmitted to a control centre, which can be many miles away.
Wind turbines are not physically staffed, although each will have  www.embracewind.com  periodic mechanical checks, often carried out by local firms.
The onboard computers also monitor the performance of each turbine component, and will automatically shut the turbine down if any problems are detected, alerting an engineer that an onsite visit is required.
The amount of electricity produced from a wind turbine depends on three factors: 1) Wind speed The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed.
Therefore if the wind blows at twice the speed, its energy content will increase eight-fold.
Turbines at a site where the wind speed averages 8 m/s produce around 75-100% more electricity than those where the average wind speed is 6 m/s.
2) Wind turbine availability This is the capability to operate when the wind is blowing, i.e.
when the wind turbine is not undergoing maintenance.
This is typically 98% or above for modern European machines.
3) The way wind turbines are arranged  Typical power curve of a wind turbine storm protection shutdown rated wind speed typical average wind speed cut-in wind speed  2 power (MW)  1  0  0  5  10  15 wind speed (m/s)  20  25  30  LIGHT AIR  MODERATE BREEZE  LIGHT BREEZE  GENTLE BREEZE  STORM  CALM  STRONG BREEZE  Wind farms are laid out so that one turbine does not take the wind away from another.
However other factors such as environmental considerations, visibility and grid connection requirements often take precedence over the optimum wind capture layout.
Stand-alone and Grid-connected Small Wind Turbines Small scale wind turbines can be used in domestic, community and smaller wind energy projects and these can be either stand-alone or grid-connected systems.
Standalone systems are used to generate electricity for charging batteries to run small electrical applications, often in remote locations where it is expensive or not physically possible to connect to a mains power supply.
Such examples include rural farms and island communities, with typical applications being water heating or pumping, electric livestock fencing, lighting or any kind of small electronic system needed to control or monitor remote equipment.
With grid-connected turbines the output from the wind turbine is directly connected to the existing mains electricity supply.
This type of system can be used both for individual wind turbines and for wind farms exporting electricity to the electricity network.
A grid-connected wind turbine can be a good proposition if your consumption of electricity is high.
@Proven Energy  www.bwea.com  VIOLENT STORM  NEAR GALE  FRESH BREEZE  SEVERE GALE  GALE  Wind Turbine Technology Sep 2005  Can We Rely on the Wind?
Wind generation is often described as intermittent, as the wind does not blow continuously.
This is a misnomer as it implies an 'all or nothing' delivery of energy.
An individual wind turbine will generate electricity for 70-85% of the time and its electricity output varies between zero and full output in accordance with the wind speed.
However, the combined output of the UK's entire wind power portfolio shows less variability, given the differences in wind speeds over the country as a whole.
Whilst the amount of wind generation varies, it rarely (if ever) goes completely to zero, nor to full output.
In order to maintain security of supplies, a second-bysecond balance between generation and demand must be achieved.
An excess of generation causes the system frequency to rise whilst an excess of demand causes the system frequency to fall.
The electricity system is designed and operated in such a way as to cope with large and small fluctuations in supply and demand.

Therefore, the system operator establishes reserves that provide a capability to achieve balance given the statistics of variations expected over different timescales.
The variability of wind generation is but one component of the generation and demand variations that are considered when setting reserve levels.
The GB System Operator, National Grid Transco stated in their Seven Year Statement that "based on recent analysis of the incidence and variation of wind speed we have found that the expected intermittency of wind does not pose such a major problem for stability and we are confident that this can be adequately managed.4"  Summary Wind turbine technology has developed and matured over the years and this technology now forms an increasingly important part of the UK's electricity industry.
Renewable energy is vital in our fight against climate change and technologies such as wind energy can help in building a sustainable electricity generation system for the future.

: D-80.1-GP.SD.03-A-A-GB  2002-09-10  page 2/9  Technical Description REpower 48/600  1  Description of the Wind Turbine  1.1 Design Concept The 48/600 wind turbine, type-tested by Germanischer Lloyd, has a nominal electrical power of 600 kW.
The rotor diameter is 48.4 m, and power control is based on the "stall" principle.
For the sake of smooth connection to the grid, a set of thyristors is interposed between the mains supply and the generator during the start phase.
Even at inland sites with relatively low wind speed, the 48/600 attains very good production because of its large rotor and correspondingly high tower.
1.2 Rotor The rotor consists of three blades rigidly flange-mounted on a cast hub.
The overall diameter is 48.4 m giving a swept area of 1840 m².
As a function of wind speed the rotational speed is 14 or 21 rpm.
This matching of rotational speed makes the 48/600 particularly suitable for inland locations.
The material of the blades is a glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GRP).
Each blade tip is pivotable and can be turned 74 degrees to the main blade.
The three blade tips are working by an independent hydraulic-system.
The hydraulic-pressure is required to keep the tips in the operational position.
1.3 Gearbox The gearbox is a planetary/spur gear system and meets all requirements of the Germanischer Lloyd classification society.
These components are designed and constructed by an experienced transmission manufacturer in accordance with REpower specifications.
The ratio is about 72.
Wind turbines made by REpower Systems AG are distinguished by their particularly quiet running.
Vibration dampers specially developed by us are used for the decoupling of structureborne noise.
These guarantee maximum attenuation between gearbox and machine bed.

: D-80.1-GP.SD.03-A-A-GB  2002-09-10  page 3/9  Technical Description REpower 48/600  1.4 Brake System The blade tip adjustment works independently in each individual blade.
If one system fails, the aerodynamic brakes in the other two blades continue to be active.
Even at maximum output, extending and twisting just one blade tip is sufficient to bring the plant into the safe rotational speed range.
In addition, there is a mechanical disk brake on the fast shaft between drive train and generator.
The two braking systems, the aerodynamic and mechanical disk brake, work independently of each other.
In order to guarantee safe braking even in the event of failure of individual components (the hydraulics, for example) or a mains failure, the braking systems are configured to be fail-safe.
Besides this, an independent power supply is provided for the controller that guarantees safe braking of the wind turbine in the event of a voltage or grid failure.
1.5 Generator The generator is a two-stage, pole-changeable asynchronous machine.
Depending on wind speed, the first stage supplies up to 160 kW and the second up to 600 kW.
The generator is of protection class IP 54.
Cooling is effected by forced-air ventilation.
Temperature sensors are installed both on the bearings and in the windings for monitoring the machine temperature.
Various covers, e.g.
on the fast shaft, make it impossible to come into contact with moving parts.
The housing of the generator is earthed in order to provide equipotential bonding.
The generator is elastically supported on the machine bed by noise and vibration-decoupling elements, for the sake of improved noise insulation and decoupling.
1.6 Yaw System The nacelle is connected to the tower by means of a four-point bearing.
Yawing of the nacelle is achieved by means of two electrical servo drives.
Hydraulic brakes serve to secure the nacelle.
In the case of grid failure the brakes are active.
An electronic wind-direction sensor system with the corresponding software controls the switch-on times and the direction of rotation of the motors.
It also operates the automatic cable untwisting when under varying wind direction the plant has turned repeatedly in one direction.

In order to provide optimal conditions for servicing and maintenance, the nacelle is of sufficiently large dimension.
Maintenance work can be done even in poor weather without opening the nacelle covering.
Access from the tower into the nacelle is gained via a hatch in the basic frame.
There is additionally a maintenance platform for accessing the components underneath the basic frame.
All components, as for example the azimuth system and the hydraulics, can be operated via the control panels of the nacelle.
For safety there is an "emergency button".
1.8 Tower The tower is made from steel piping and consists of three segments, regardless of the hub height.
In accordance with regulations there are various assembly platforms in the tower as well as additional landings incorporated into the ladder.
An internal ladder makes it possible to ascend regardless of the weather.
The power cabinets are accommodated in the bottom of the tower and are thus protected against the effects of weather.
The plant can be completely operated from here.
For safety, an "emergency button" is provided here as well.
1.9 Corrosion Protection All parts of the plant, from the tower through the machine bed and on to the nacelle covering, are protected by a special multiple coating against corrosion and other environmental influences.
The coating system complies with all the requirements of DIN EN ISO 12944.
1.10 Lightning Protection The rotor blades are fitted with a proven lightning protection system.
Lightning is led away via receptors in the rotor tips and the "tip cables" connected to them, which control the blade tips.
The lightning is transmitted to the bearing ring via slip-rings and air gaps on the main shaft.
From there, the overvoltage is led off to the tower and finally into the ground via foundation earth electrodes and deep earth electrodes.

The remote data monitoring software is supplied when the wind turbine is erected.
Some of the most important operational data that can be retrieved via remote data transmission are mentioned below:  Momentary electrical power of generator Rotor and generator rotational speed Gearbox and bearing temperatures Hydraulic pressures (pitch adjustment of the blade tips, disk brake, etc.)
Azimuth angle Momentary wind speed and direction Statistics: - daily, monthly and annual energy production figures - fault statistics, and much else.
Faults can be detected and eliminated using these operational data.
In addition, in the event of faults in plant operation, the corresponding error message is sent automatically to the responsible service point via remote data monitoring so that rectification of the fault is organised and performed without delay.
Besides the fundamentally low liability to faults of the type 48/600 wind power plant, this automatic fault reporting assists in attaining high availability.
